<a name=/area/room>
<h2>rooms</h2>

<p>Areas that are not located on the map are referred to as <em>rooms</em>.
When a player enters one, the map goes away and you have something like a text
MUD.  By default, there would be no way for players to move from one room to
another, so you have to handle movement yourself.

<p>You can check the variable <a href=#/atom/var/x>area.x</a> to see if a
given area is on the map or not.

<p>The following example puts players in a room when they log in and provides
a single exit.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/Login()
   if(!loc) Move(locate(/area/birthing_hut))
   return ..()

area/birthing_hut
   Entered(O)
      O << "Waaaaah!  You land in a pile of straw."
      return ..()
   verb/exit()
      if(Move(locate(1,1,1))) //jump to the map or whatever
         usr << "You crawl into the open air..."
      else
         usr << "The hut door is blocked.  You cannot get out."
</xmp>
