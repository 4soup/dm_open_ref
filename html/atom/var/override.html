<h2>override var (atom)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>0
</dl>

<p><b>Currently this only applies to <a href=#/image>images</a>.</b>

<p>If you attach an image to an atom, normally it is seen only in addition to
the atom's regular icon. If the image's override var is 1, it will be seen
<i>in place of</i> the original atom (and its overlays).  It will inherit the
atom's color, alpha, transform, and appearance_flags, unless its own
appearance_flags say otherwise.

<p>If the image has a specific name and/or suffix value, those will override
the parent atom too. Leaving them blank will let the original atom take
precedence.
