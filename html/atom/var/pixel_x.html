<p>This displaces the object's icon on the x-axis by the specified number of
pixels. In a project with a standard 32x32 tile size, this can range from -32
to +32. (You can get away with larger displacements, but they are not
guaranteed to work for objects off the edge of the map.)

<p>Since overlays and images can each have their own additional displacements,
this makes it possible to create visual effects that extend beyond the
object's own cell in the turf grid, but which automatically move around with
the object.

<p>This effect is purely visual and does not influence such things as movement
bumping or view() range calculations.
