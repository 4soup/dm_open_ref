<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>List of contained objects.
</dl>

<p>Except in the case of areas, this list is always restricted to objs and
mobs (ie movable objects).  Only direct contents are listed.  Items inside of
a bag object, for example, would not show up in the mob's contents list.

<p>The contents of areas are a little different.  The turfs contained in the
area are in the list along with any objs or mobs directly contained by those
turfs.

<p>If a movable atom uses the bound vars to change its physical size, or
<tt>step_x</tt> or <tt>step_y</tt> to change its position, it may cover more
than one turf. In that case, those turfs' contents won't just contain anything
directly in them, but also any atoms overhanging them. I.e., if a turf is in a
mob's <tt>locs</tt> list, then the mob is in that turf's contents list. (See
<a class=code href=#/atom/movable/var/locs>locs</a> for more information.)

<p class=performance>Note: Looping through all of the atoms, or even just
turfs, in a particular area actually loops through every turf in the world.
E.g., <tt>for(var/turf/T in area)</tt>. The engine will check each turf to see
if it belongs to that area, and then includes the turf and/or its contents in
the results depending on what the loop is looking for. This also applies to
any situation where you might grab area.contents as a list, e.g.
<tt>area.contents.Copy()</tt>. Therefore in a large world, it's advisable not
to loop through area contents at all.
