<p>This is optional text that will be displayed in the same position as the
atom. If an atom has both an icon and maptext, the text will be displayed in
front of the icon. Usually however, this is something that would be added to
an overlay or image object, which can then be positioned with pixel offsets.

<p>Map text is constrained to the bounds set by maptext_width and
maptext_height, which default to a single icon in size. It can be offset by
maptext_x and maptext_y.</p>

<p>Text can use HTML and CSS, mostly the same limited subset supported by
regular text output, and different styles can be used in the same block of
text. In addition, alpha colors can also be used, by specifying a color as
#rrggbbaa instead of just #rrggbb. (Alpha transparency will be ignored when
the map is drawn without hardware rendering, so anything below 50% opacity
is not displayed in those cases.)

<p>Maptext supports links with the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag. Left-clicking on
a link will follow the link, but also generate other events such as
<tt>MouseDown</tt> or <tt>Click</tt>.
