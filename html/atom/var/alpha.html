<p>Controls the opacity of the icon displayed on players' screens. A value of
128 means the atom is half-transparent, so it will have a ghostly appearance.
This can be used to fade an atom in and out, especially when combined with
animation. Alpha is also applied to maptext.

<p>Overlays and images will also be affected by alpha, unless they use the
RESET_ALPHA value in appearance_flags.
