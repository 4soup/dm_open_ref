<dd>null (white)
<dd>any <a href=#/{{appendix}}/html-colors>color</a> generated by <tt>rgb()</tt> (e.g., <tt>"#00ff00"</tt> for green)
<dd>a <a href=#/{notes}/color-matrix>color matrix</a> (in list form)
</dl>

<p>Controls the color of the icon displayed on players' screens. This color
is multiplied by the icon, so that a white icon will become this color. The
color multiplier is also applied to <tt>maptext</tt>.

<p>If you include an alpha component in the color, the atom's alpha var will
be set at the same time.

<p>Overlays and images will also be multiplied by this color, unless they use
the <tt>RESET_COLOR</tt> value in <tt>appearance_flags</tt>.

<p>The color value can be set to a
<a href=#/{notes}/color-matrix>color matrix</a>, which is a list of values.
This allows for more complex transformations such as adding or subtracting
color, inverting the color, turning to grayscale, shifting hue, etc. Using an
RGB-only color matrix will include the existing alpha value in the matrix.

<p>When reading the <tt>color</tt> var, if it is a matrix it will be read out
as a list with 20 items (full RGBA format). That list is a copy, so if you
save it and make changes to that list later it will not impact the actual
color of the atom. This also means you can't use <tt>color[9] = 0.5</tt>; you
would have to grab the value of <tt>color</tt> first, make sure it's a list,
change it, and then assign the changed list back to the <tt>color</tt> var.
