<p>If any icon uses <tt>render_target</tt>, and another icon in the scene has
a matching <tt>render_source</tt>, this icon will be drawn to a temporary
image called a "slate", which can be reused mutiple times for faster drawing
and for special effects.

<p>If the <tt>render_target</tt> value starts with an asterisk (<tt>"*"</tt>),
it will not be drawn on the map, but will still be drawn to a slate for reuse.

<p>Other vars that would normally affect the appearance of this icon, such as
<tt>color</tt>, <tt>transform</tt>, <tt>filters</tt>, <tt>appearance_flags</tt>,
etc. are all applied when drawing to the slate. Additionally, if this object
has overlays, underlays, or visual contents and uses the
<a href=#/atom/var/appearance_flags><tt>KEEP_TOGETHER</tt></a> flag to group
all of the icons together, those will also be included in the slate.

<p>If the render target is a
<a href=#/atom/var/appearance_flags><tt>PLANE_MASTER</tt></a>, vars like
<tt>pixel_x/y/w/z</tt> will not apply when it is re-drawn as a
<tt>render_source</tt>.

<div class=note>
<p>To use a <tt>render_target</tt>, the object it belongs to must be
within the visible part of the map, or in the HUD, etc., so that it would be
visible to the user under normal circumstances. If not, it will not be
included in the render process and therefore it can't be reused as a
<tt>render_source</tt>.

<p>Additionally, if you use multiple map controls, a given render target can
only be used as a source on the same map control where it appears. This is
because each map is rendered separately.
