<a name=/atom/var/text>
<h2>text var (atom)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>The first letter of the object's name.
</dl>

<p>This is the character used to represent the object on text clients.

<p>Entering several characters produces a text movie (the state of the art!).
In that case, each character is displayed for a 10th of a second.

<p>HTML tags in the text can be used to modify the colors of the text
characters.  As a convenience, the &lt;font&gt; tag may include a
<code>bgcolor</code> attribute, so you don't have to do a CSS style setting to
accomplish the same thing.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
world
   maxx = 10
   maxy = 10
area
   text = "<font bgcolor=blue> "
turf
   text = "<font color=#F00>....<font color=#C00>.."
</xmp>

<p>The example above produces a map with a blue background (from the area) and
turfs (depicted by ".") that flash from bright red to a shorter span of light
red.

<p>Note that in order to see text icons, the user must switch to the text map
in Dream Seeker.  If your DM code never does anything with the icon variable,
then this is the default configuration.  Such applications are known as
<em>advanced</em> iconic text games:)
