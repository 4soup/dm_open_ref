<p>Turfs, movable atoms, and images can be given a list of atoms (limited to
turfs and movable atoms) that are attached to them visually, like an overlay
or image object, but act independently and have their own identity. These are
<b>visual contents</b>. The purpose of visual contents is to provide an
alternative system to overlays and images, with a little more flexibility for
various special effects.

<p>For example, a mob with an obj in its visual contents will show the obj
as if it's following the mob around like an overlay, but clicking on the obj
will not&mdash;unlike an overlay or an image object&mdash;count as a click
on the mob. Likewise, the obj will retain its own separate
<tt>mouse_opacity</tt> setting, which is not true of regular overlays.

<p>An atom that appears on the map normally can still be in the visual
contents of another atom. However it will not apply gliding and step offsets
here. Also, considerations like visibility will not apply.

<p>If a turf is in an atom's visual contents, the turf and all of that turf's
contents will be displayed. (In the case of big atoms, or movable atoms with
step offsets, only atoms that actually have that turf as their loc will
appear. "Overhangers" will not.) Gliding and step offsets <em>will</em> be
applied to that turf's contents normally; but again visibility, opacity, etc.
will not be considered. (If you have one or more turfs in visual contents,
an object gliding to a new turf outside of that list will not be shown because
it's already technically on the new turf.)

<p>If <i>multiple</i> turfs are present in visual contents, they will be
offset as needed (relative to the southwest-most turf) to appear in the
correct positions. That is, <tt>pixel_x</tt> and <tt>pixel_y</tt> offsets will
be applied automatically, so if you add an entire block to visual contents (be
aware this will impact performance), you don't have to do anything else to
make the block appear normal.

<p>You can alter some aspects of how an object behaves when in visual contents
by changing its <a class=code href=#/atom/var/vis_flags>vis_flags</a> var. In
particular this is useful if you want an object to behave more like an
overlay, inheriting aspects of its parent object or even acting like a part of
that object instead of an independent one. Also this can make an object act
like an underlay instead of an overlay when using a floating layer.

<p>Visual contents do not impact the results of <tt>view()</tt> or
<tt>range()</tt>, or verb availability, in any way. This is strictly a visual
effect.

<p>Being in a visual contents list counts as a <a href=#/DM/garbage>reference</a>
for anything in the list, the same way that being on the map or inside of a
movable counts as a reference.
