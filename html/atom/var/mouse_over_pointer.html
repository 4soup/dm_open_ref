<dd>MOUSE_INACTIVE_POINTER (0)
</dl>

<p>This defines how the mouse looks when no buttons are pressed and it is held
over this object.  Assigning this to MOUSE_ACTIVE_POINTER (1) enables the
default indicator that there is something special under the mouse
(crosshairs).

<p>This variable may also be set to any of the other
<a href=#/DM/mouse/pointers>built-in mouse pointers</a>, or a custom icon or
icon state.  If an icon state is specified, this is applied against the object's
main icon to find a custom pointer.

<p>Note that all mouse pointers are purely visual indicators.  They do not
effect what objects may actually be manipulated with the mouse.  You control
all of the real behavior in the associated procedures.
