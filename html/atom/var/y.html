<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>The y coordinate of the object on the map.
</dl>

<p>You may assign the coordinates of movable objects (mobs and objs), but this
is not advisable.  It is better to compute the new location (with
<code>locate()</code>) and move them to that.  Then you can use the normal
<code>Move()</code> procedure, which enables all the normal movement behavior.

<p>For areas that are on the map, this is the coordinate of the turf with the
lowest z, y, and x coordinate (in that order) that is contained by the area.
