<p>Icons may appear differently depending on the icon state.  For example,
turf door icons could have "open" and "closed" states.  If a state is
specified that does not exist in the icon file, the default null state will
be displayed if it exists.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
turf/door
   icon_state = "closed"
   density = 1
   verb
      open()
         set src in view(1)
         icon_state = "open"
         density = 0
      close()
         set src in view(1)
         icon_state = "closed"
         density = 1
</xmp>
