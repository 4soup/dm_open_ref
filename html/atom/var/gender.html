<p>This sets the object's gender.  This influences text macros like
<code>\he</code>, which may expand to "it", "he", "she", or "they".  Valid
values are:

<xmp>
"neuter"
"male"
"female"
"plural"
</xmp>

These are also defined as constants, which may help prevent typos, since the
compiler will complain if it doesn't recognize what you type:

<xmp>
NEUTER
MALE
FEMALE
PLURAL
</xmp>
