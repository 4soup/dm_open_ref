<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>The list of verbs defined for the object's prototype.
</dl>

<p>This is a list of the object's verbs.  Initially, it contains all of the
verbs defined in the prototype.  It may be used to add and remove verbs at
runtime.

<p>Note that this variable is not automatically saved when the object is
written to a savefile.  That behavior may change in the future.  In the mean
time, you must save any necessary changes yourself or they will not be
preserved when the object is loaded.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/proc/kazaam()
   usr << "Kazaam!"

mob/verb/add_kazaam()
   verbs += /mob/proc/kazaam
mob/verb/remove_kazaam()
   verbs -= /mob/proc/kazaam
</xmp>
