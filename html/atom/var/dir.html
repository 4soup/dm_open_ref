<p>This is the direction that the object is facing.  This has little effect
unless the object's icon is directional.  In the case of a directional icon,
this selects the corresponding orientation from the icon file.

<p>An icon file with only four (cardinal) directions makes the choice of
orientation ambiguous when the true direction is a diagonal.  In that case, of
the two possibilities, the one closest to the previous orientation is
displayed.  Sounds complicated, but it's what one would naturally expect.
