<p>This causes the object to be visible in the dark to mobs that can see
infrared light.  Nothing but the object itself is lit up by the infrared
emission.  The scale is identical to luminosity: 1 makes it visible only from
the same location; 2 makes it visible from a neighboring position; and so on.
