<p>This may be used to control how mouse operations on an object are
interpreted.  A click or mouse movement over an object's icon normally applies
to that object only if it is the topmost object that is not transparent at
the position of the mouse.  Setting <tt>mouse_opacity</tt> to 0 would cause
the object to be ignored completely, and setting it to 2 causes it to always
be chosen over any lower-level objects, regardless of the transparency of its
icon.

<p>Note that overlays and underlays are not distinct objects, so their
<tt>mouse_opacity</tt> is completely ignored in favor of the object they're
attached to. The same applies to <a href=#/image>image objects</a>, which act
like special overlays as well. <a href=#/atom/var/vis_contents>Visual
contents</a>, on the other hand, are separate objects that can act like
overlays in some ways, but because they're separate their
<tt>mouse_opacity</tt> <i>is</i> taken into account.

<p>When this is applied to a <tt>PLANE_MASTER</tt> object (see
<a href=#/atom/var/appearance_flags>appearance_flags</a>), a value of 0 means
everything on the plane is mouse-transparent.  1 means everything on the
plane is mouse-visible (using the objects' normal mouse_opacity), but the
plane master itself is not.  2 means everything on the plane is mouse-visible,
and so is the plane master.
