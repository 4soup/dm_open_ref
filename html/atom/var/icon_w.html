<p>Defines the anchor point for this icon, from the bottom left. Higher values
of icon_w will offset this icon to the left; lower values offset it to the
right. It acts like a negative pixel_w except it's not inherited by any
<a href=#/atom/var/overlays>overlays</a>, <a href=#/image>images</a>, or
<a href=#/atom/var/vis_contents>visual contents</a>. It applies ONLY to this
icon.

<p>This var is meant to replace the <tt>bound_x</tt> var, which was applied
very inconsistently in old versions.
