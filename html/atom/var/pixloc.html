<p>Returns a pixloc representing this atom's <tt>loc</tt>, <tt>step_x</tt>,
and <tt>step_y</tt> positions. This var is read-only for areas and turfs, but
writable for movable atoms. When changed, it will alter the related vars. A
movable's pixloc is null if it isn't located on a turf.

<p>A pixloc can be used for calculating distances, or passed to various procs
such as <a class=code href=#/proc/get_dir>get_dir()</a> and
<a class=code href=#/atom/movable/proc/Move>Move()</a>.

<p>This pixloc does not take bounds into account. See
<a class=code href=#/proc/bound_pixloc>bound_pixloc()</a> for getting the
pixloc of an atom's corners or center of bounds.

<p>The returned pixloc is not tied to this atom, so changing its vars will not
alter the atom's pixloc. The only exception is when using operators such as
<tt>+=</tt>, since <tt>a += b</tt> is just a shortcut for <tt>a = a + b</tt>.

<xmp>
// does not alter obj's position
var/pixloc/p = obj.pixloc
p.step_x += 12

// does alter obj's position, since a += b is just a = a + b
obj.pixloc += vector(12,0)
</xmp>
