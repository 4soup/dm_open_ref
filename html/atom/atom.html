<p>The /atom object type is the ancestor of all mappable objects in the
game.  The types /area, /turf, /obj, and /mob are all derived from /atom.
You should not create instances of /atom directly but should use /area,
/turf, /obj, and /mob for actual objects.  The /atom object type exists for
the purpose of defining variables or procedures that are shared by all of
the other "physical" objects.  These are also the only objects for which
verbs may be accessible to the user.

<p>/atom is derived from /datum, so it inherits the basic properties that
are shared by all DM objects.
