<p>This read-only var tells which turfs are being physically covered by the
atom's bounding box. The purpose of this is for cases where you set the
atom's bounds to change its physical size so that it ends up covering more
than one turf.

<p>This is different from the loc var in that every atom still has only one
"true" location. A movable atom may cover multiple turfs, but only one turf
is its loc. The loc var can be thought of as an anchor point, while the
actual physical footprint is in locs.

<p>For every turf in locs, this atom will also be in that turf's contents
list.

<p>If loc is not a turf, it will be the only item in the locs list. If loc
is null, locs will be empty.
