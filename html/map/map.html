<p>One or more map files may be loaded into the world's map.  These are
loaded into successive z-levels.  If no map files are specified, the default
project map file will be used.  This file has the same name as the project
but has the extension .dmm.

<p>If no map files are loaded, the world's map size is determined by the
world variables maxx, maxy, and maxz.  The default content of this map is
determined by the world variables turf and area.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
#include "level1.dmm"
#include "level2.dmm"
#include "level3.dmm"
</xmp>
