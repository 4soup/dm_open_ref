<p>The parameters to a verb are referred to as arguments.  For verbs, the
input type and possible value list may also be specified.

<p>The possible input types are:

<pre>
text          // a quoted text string
password      // un-echoed text (for use with input() only)
message       // multi-line text
command_text  // raw command text from the rest of the input line
num           // a number
icon          // an icon file from the user's computer
sound         // a sound file from the user's computer
file          // any type of file from the user's computer
key           // a key from the user's BYOND key file
color         // a color (see <a href=#/proc/rgb>rgb proc</a>)
null          // indicates that the argument is optional

mob
obj
turf
area
anything
</pre>

<p>These can be combined with the '|' operator.  The first group are called
<EM>constant</EM> input types because they turn on various types of literal
values that the user can type in (like a number or a text string).  The
second group work in conjunction with a list of objects or values.  They are
called input type <EM>filters</EM> because they may be used to filter out
certain types of values from the list.  For example a mob or an obj within
sight would be specified as follows:

<xmp>
myverb(M as mob|obj in view()) {...}
</xmp>

<p>A default value may be specified which takes effect in the case of null
arguments.  For example:

<xmp>
myverb(M=usr as null|mob|obj in view()) {...}
</xmp>

<p>In this example, the input type <code>null</code> did not have to be used
explicitly, because assigning a default value (in this case
<code>usr</code>) turns it on by default.

<p>The <code>anything</code> input type can be used to combine values in a
list with other constant input types.  Here, this is done with the
<code>null</code> input type:

<xmp>
set_aggression(a="on" as null|anything in list("on","off"))
</xmp>

<p>For input types containing mob, obj, turf, or area, the possible value
list defaults to view().

<p>If no input type is specified, the variable type will be used to
determine whether it is a mob, obj, turf, or area.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/tell(mob/M,msg as text)
  M << "[usr] tells you, /"[msg]/""
</xmp>

<p>This example defines a verb with two arguments: a target mob, and some
text.
