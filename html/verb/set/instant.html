<p>Normally a player can only call one verb per tick, but they can call any
number of "instant" verbs in the same tick. This setting is useful for commands
called by the game's interface, or for more responsive controls like for
instance the use of "combos" in fighting games.

<p>Verbs with the instant setting can be used on the same tick as a regular
verb, but only one regular verb can be used each tick. Instant commands will
jump ahead of non-instant commands in the queue.

<p>Any verbs that are already built-in, such as movement commands, cannot be
modified to use this setting. (Some, such as mouse commands, already use it.)
You can, however, create replacement verbs of your own for most of them.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/FastNorth()
  set instant = 1
  usr.Move(get_step(usr,NORTH), NORTH)
</xmp>
