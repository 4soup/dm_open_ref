<p>This value determines the limits that a client's eye will display.
If <code>client.perspective</code> uses the <code>EDGE_PERSPECTIVE</code> flag,
the view shouldn't scroll beyond the bounds set by <code>edge_limit</code>. If
the bounds of <code>edge_limit</code> are as big as or smaller than the
client's view, no scrolling will occur even if <code>EDGE_PERSPECTIVE</code>
is not used. Normally this value is null, which provides freedom for the eye
to move anywhere on the map. It may be changed to a text value describing the
limits in more detail.

<p>The format is similar to <code>atom.screen_loc</code> which uses
<code>"[x1],[y1]&nbsp;to&nbsp;[x2],[y2]"</code>. It can also use directions
such as <code>"SOUTHWEST&nbsp;to&nbsp;NORTHEAST"</code>, which refer to the
limits of the map.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
area/house
  var/x1,x2,y1,y2

  Entered(mob/M)
    if(ismob(M) && M.client)
      M.client.edge_limit = "[x1],[y1] to [x2],[y2]"

  Exited(mob/M)
    if(ismob(M) && M.client)
      M.client.edge_limit = null
</xmp>
