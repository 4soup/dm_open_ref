<h2 byondver=509>bounds var (client)</h2>

(Also <tt>bound_x</tt>, <tt>bound_y</tt>, <tt>bound_width</tt>, and
<tt>bound_height</tt>.)

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/proc/bounds>bounds proc</a>
</dl>

<p>The read-only bounds var returns the map coordinates, in pixels, covered
by the client's viewport when accounting for pixel offsets, eye, step, etc.
(The coordinates are only relevant to the default <tt>client.dir</tt> value of
<tt>NORTH</tt>, and the <tt>TOPDOWN_MAP</tt> or <tt>SIDE_MAP</tt> map
formats.)

<p>If the viewport is not currently on the map (for instance, when the eye is
at a null location), the var reads as null.  Otherwise, it is a list with
five values (x, y, width, height, z) in the same form used by the bounds proc.

<p>The alias vars bound_x, bound_y, bound_width, and bound_height can also
be used to retrieve the individual values from the list.  They too will be
null if the viewport is not on the map.
