<p>This is a client version of world.fps, so that the client can run at a
faster speed for animations.  For example, setting client.fps to 40 while
world.fps is the default 10 will mean that all animations and glides are
smoothed out and displayed at 40 FPS, even though the server still runs at
10 FPS.  The result is a nicer-looking game with no additional impact on the
server.

<p>When this value is 0, the client and server tick at the same rate.
