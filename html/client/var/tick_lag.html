<p>This is a client version of world.tick_lag, so that the client can run at
a faster speed for animations.  For example, setting client.tick_lag to 0.25
while world.tick_lag is the default 1 will mean that all animations and
glides are smoothed out and displayed at 40 FPS, even though the server still
runs at 10 FPS.  The result is a nicer-looking game with no additional impact
on the server.

<p>When this value is 0, the client and server tick at the same rate.
