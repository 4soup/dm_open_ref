<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>NORTH
</dl>

<p>This defines the relationship between the world's coordinate system and the
player's screen.  The default means that the player sees the map exactly as it
was created (in the map-editor or at runtime).  Changing it to one of the
other directions causes the player to see the map as if it were rotated to
that direction.  This means that a player with client.dir = SOUTH would see
the map inverted relative to a person with client.dir = NORTH.  That's handy
in two-player board games where you want both players to see their side in the
same place.

<p>Note that this does not turn icons upside down!  The map is rotated, but
the icons on the map remain in their normal orientation.

<p>Movement keys are remapped so that a player with client.dir = SOUTH hitting
the up arrow will generate a call to client.South() rather than the usual
client.North().
