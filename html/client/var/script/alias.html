<p>Command aliases have a syntax similar to verbs.  They define a command
and a series of arguments which can then be used to execute a new command.
The most common use for this is in a telnet world like a MUD.  By defining
aliases corresponding to the MUD commands, the player can have primitive
command expansion and help.

<p>The syntax of an alias definition is best illustrated by the following
example:

<xmp>
alias/say(msg as text)
   set desc = "speak your mind"
   return "say [msg]"
</xmp>

<p>As you can see, it is just like a verb.  Alias have all the same
properties as verbs, except the <code>src</code> setting is always equal to
the player.

<p>The value returned by an alias is executed as a command.  In telnet mode,
the command to execute is often simply the same as the command that was
entered (since the alias was only defined to provide command expansion and
help).  Since that is such a common case, the return value defaults to the
alias name followed by each of the arguments.  The example above, for
instance, would have the same effect without an explicit return statement.

<p>Note that commands executed via an alias are never interpreted as
aliases.  Otherwise, examples such as the one above would result in an
infinite loop.
