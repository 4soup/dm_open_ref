<p>Style sheets may be included in DM Script by putting the style sheet
inside the HTML tags <code>&lt;STYLE&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;/STYLE&gt;</code>.  In general, any text enclosed in start
and end tags will be sent to the player's terminal, so you could use
<code>client.script</code> to output a welcome message as well as loading a
style sheet.

<p><h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
client/script = "<STYLE>BODY {background: black; color: aqua}</STYLE>"
</xmp>

<p>This example style sheet makes the player's terminal have a black
background and aqua colored text.  When changing the background color, it is
important to change the color of system and link text as well.  See the
section on <a href=#/DM/text/style>style sheets</a> for an example.
