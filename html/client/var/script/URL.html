<a name=/client/var/script/URL>
<h2>URL (client script)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>#define URL "byond://byond.com:6000"
</dl>

<p>Defining a URL in a script, specifies the world to connect to when the
script is executed by the player.  This is referred to as a connection
script, because the player uses it to connect to a world.  Other
post-connection scripts such as <code>byond.dms</code> or a script loaded
through <code>client.script</code> are only used to configure the client
after it has connected to a world.  In those cases, the URL setting has no
effect.

<p>It is important to enclose the URL in double quotes.  Otherwise, the
<code>//</code> symbol would be mistaken for a comment.
