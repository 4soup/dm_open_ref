<a name=/client/var/preload_rsc>
<h2>preload_rsc var (client)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>1.
</dl>

<p>This variable controls whether resource files (icons and sounds) are
automatically downloaded by Dream Seeker when first connecting, or whether
they should be downloaded as needed.  Resource files are cached (in
byond.rsc) for future use, so this should only affect people who have not
played the game before or who have not played it for some time.

<p>The three possible settings are:
<dl compact>
<dt>0<dd>do not preload any resources
<dt>1<dd>preload compiled-in resources only
<dt>2<dd>preload all resources including those uploaded by players
<dt>URL<dd>preload resources from specified file
</dl>

<p>Preloading resource files will eliminate delays later on, but may cause
a very long initial delay when logging in.

<p>Resources may also be distributed from a website to save bandwidth on the
machine hosting the game.  Simply zip up the .rsc file, upload it to a web
site, and put the URL here.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
client/preload_rsc = "http://dan.byond.com/mygame_rsc.zip"
</xmp>

<p>Instead of putting the .rsc file in the .zip, you can also put the
individual resource files there.  This would allow you to select specific
files that you would like to be preloaded.  For example, you could create a
different resource package for different parts of the game world and assign
client.preload_rsc dynamically as the player moves into each different area.

<p>Once Dream Seeker has downloaded a resource package, it caches it and will
not download it again, even if you upload a new version of the file.  This
allows you to make small changes without forcing a complete refresh.  Any
files which are not found in the preload package are simply downloaded from
the game server directly.

<p>If you want to force a complete refresh, simply change the name of the
resource package.  For example, you could put a version number in the name of
the file: <tt>mygame_rsc_01.zip</tt>, <tt>mygame_rsc_02.zip</tt>, and so on.
