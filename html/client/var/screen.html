<p>This is a list of objects that are displayed on the user's screen.  The
object's screen_loc variable controls where it appears (if it appears at all).
This allows one to create the elements of a graphical user interface, with
such features as buttons, drag/drop areas, and stat monitors.

<p>Screen objects (visible or otherwise) may also be used to make verbs
available to users.  To make them accessible, define verbs on the screen
object like this:

<xmp>
set src in usr.client.screen
</xmp>
