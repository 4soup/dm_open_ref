<p>This is the client's gender, which is an attribute of the player's key.
By default, when a new mob is made for a player (in client.New()), the new
mob gets the same name and gender as the player's key.  This influences text
macros like <code>\he</code>, which may expand to "it", "he", "she", or
"they".  Valid values are:

<xmp>
"neuter"
"male"
"female"
"plural"
</xmp>
