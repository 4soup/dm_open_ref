<p>Client scripts are mini-programs used to configure the client.  The
language they use is called DM Script, and will undoubtedly expand in the
future.  Currently, client scripts can be used to define style sheets,
command aliases, and macros.  When executed directly by a player, they can
also be used to specify an initial URL to open and a password trigger (for
some ancient telnet worlds that don't suppress password echo).

<p>For the specific syntax of DM Script, see the relevant reference sections
listed above.

<p>The <code>client.script</code> variable may be assigned to script code in
a text string (double quotes) or in a file (single quotes).  You can also
simply include the file in your project or explicitly use the
<code>#include</code> statement.  Files containing DM Script should have the
extension <code>.dms</code>.

<p><h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
client/script = "<STYLE>BODY {font: monospace}</STYLE>"
</xmp>

<p>This example selects a default monospace font for all output to the
terminal.

<p>In addition to scripts loaded via <code>client.script</code>, the player
may have <em>client-side</em> scripts.  These are either called
<em>connection</em> scripts or <em>post-connection</em> scripts depending on
whether they are used to automatically connect to a world or whether they
are executed automatically after connecting to a world.  In either case, the
player's scripts are always executed before the designer's
<code>client.script</code> script, so style sheets from the designer have
higher precedence by default.

<p>There are three post-connection client-side scripts for the three types
of worlds the client can connect to: <code>byond.dms</code>,
<code>telnet.dms</code>, and <code>irc.dms</code>.  These are automatically
executed if the player connects directly to a world without using a
connection script to do so.  The intention is to load any standard
configurations such as style sheets and command aliases.
