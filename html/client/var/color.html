<p>Casts a color multiplication or <a href=#/{notes}/color-matrix>matrix</a>
effect over the entire main map.  This behaves exactly the same as
atom.color, and will be combined with atom.color (which comes first) where
present.  See <a href=#/atom/var/color>atom.color</a> for more information.

<p>If a matrix is used, the alpha column and row will have no effect.

<p>Icons that have the NO_CLIENT_COLOR value in appearance_flags will not be
subject to client.color.  This can be useful for HUD objects.

<p>This value can be animated.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/proc/DayNight(is_day)
    if(client)
        client.color = is_day ? \
            null : \
            list(0.2,0.05,0.05, 0.1,0.3,0.2, 0.1,0.1,0.4)
</xmp>
