<h2>CGI var (client)</h2>

<p>In CGI mode, DreamDaemon is normally being executed by a web server and
accessed by a web browser.  The CGI object is an add-on to the basic client
object for handling this case.

<p>The CGI object is defined and documented in a separate code library
<code>html/CGI.dm</code>.  You can find the current version at
