<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>MouseEntered(object,location,control,params)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>object: the object under the mouse pointer
<dd>location: the turf, stat panel, grid cell, etc. containing the object where it was clicked
<dd>control: the name of the skin control involved
<dd>params: other parameters including mouse/keyboard flags, icon offsets, etc.; see <a href=#/DM/mouse>mouse handling</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>Call object.MouseEntered(location,control,params).
</dl>

<p>This is called when no mouse buttons are pressed while pointing to the
object.

<p>Don't define this unless you need it, because it generates extra
communication that is otherwise avoided.  Defining it on only the objects that
require it reduces overhead.

<p>The argument format for this verb is:

<xmp>
MouseEntered(object as null|atom in usr.client,\
             location as null|turf|text in usr.client,\
             control as text, params as text)
</xmp>
