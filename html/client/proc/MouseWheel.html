<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>MouseWheel(object,delta_x,delta_y,location,control,params)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>object: the object under the mouse pointer
<dd>delta_x,delta_y: amount of wheel movement
<dd>location: the turf, stat panel, grid cell, etc. containing the object
<dd>control: the name of the skin control involved
<dd>params: other parameters including mouse/keyboard flags, icon offsets, etc.; see <a href=#/DM/mouse>mouse handling</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>Call object.MouseWheel(delta_x,delta_y,location,control,params).
</dl>

<p>This is called when the mouse wheel is moved while over an object or
control. It is NOT called if over a browser control, or any control that is
currently scrollable.

<p>Positive values of delta_x and delta_y refer to scrolling right or up,
respectively. Negative values are left and down, respectively.

<p>Don't define this unless you need it, because it generates extra
communication that is otherwise avoided.  If you only need wheel support on
specific objects, use atom.MouseWheel() instead which is more selective.

<p>The argument format for this verb is:

<xmp>
MouseWheel(object as null|atom in usr.client,\
           delta_x as num, delta_y as num,\
           location as null|turf|text in usr.client,\
           control as text, params as text)
</xmp>
