<p>When no query parameters are given, this returns the client-side file last
exported with <code>client.Export()</code>.  This comes as an entry in the
resource cache, which can be opened as a savefile among other things.  If
there is no file, null is returned.  For an example, see
<a href=#/client/proc/Export>client.Export</a>.

<p>When there are query parameters, these may be used to import a file from
some alternate source.  Currently this is not supported.
