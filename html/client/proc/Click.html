<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>Click(object,location,control,params)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>When:</b>
<dd>Called when the player clicks on the map or in the stat panels.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>object: the object clicked
<dd>location: the client stat panel, location (turf) of object on map, grid cell, or other control-specific info
<dd>control: the name of the skin control involved
<dd>params: other parameters including mouse/keyboard flags, icon offsets, etc.; see <a href=#/DM/mouse>mouse handling</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>Call object.Click(location,control,params).
</dl>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
client
  Click(O)
    usr << "You clicked [O]"
    ..() // do default action
</xmp>

<p>Note that due to network lag, it is possible when clicking on moving
objects for the location of those objects to have changed by the time the
Click() proc is executed.  That is the reason for the location argument.  It
tells you where the click originally took place.

<p>The argument format for this verb is:

<xmp>
Click(object as null|atom in usr.client,\
      location as null|turf|text in usr.client,\
      control as text, params as text)
</xmp>
