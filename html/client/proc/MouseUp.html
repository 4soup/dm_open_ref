<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>MouseUp(object,location,control,params)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>object: the object under the mouse pointer
<dd>location: the turf, stat panel, grid cell, etc. containing the object where it was clicked
<dd>control: the name of the skin control involved
<dd>params: other parameters including mouse/keyboard flags, icon offsets, etc.; see <a href=#/DM/mouse>mouse handling</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>Call object.MouseUp(location,control,params).
</dl>

<p>This is called when a mouse button is released while pointing to
an object.

<p>Don't define this unless you need it, because it generates extra
communication that is otherwise avoided.  Most operations can be done through
<tt>Click()</tt>, <tt>DblClick()</tt>, and <tt>MouseDrop()</tt>. The other
procedures are simply available for completeness.

<p>The argument format for this verb is:

<xmp>
MouseUp(object as null|atom in usr.client,\
        location as null|turf|text in usr.client,\
        control as text, params as text)
</xmp>

<p class=compatibility>Note: In BYOND 3.5 this procedure took three different
arguments: <tt>location</tt>, <tt>icon_x</tt>, and <tt>icon_y</tt>. Since
<tt>icon_x</tt> and <tt>icon_y</tt> have been replaced, old code will need to
be modified. Games compiled before this change will still work normally.
