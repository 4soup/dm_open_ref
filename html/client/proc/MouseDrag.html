</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>src_object: the object being dragged
<dd>over_object: the object under the mouse pointer
<dd>src_location: the turf, stat panel, grid cell, etc. from where the src object was dragged
<dd>over_location: the turf, stat panel, grid cell, etc. containing the object under the mouse pointer
<dd>src_control: The id of the skin control the object was dragged from
<dd>over_control: The id of the skin control the object was dragged over
<dd>params: other parameters including mouse/keyboard flags, icon offsets, etc.; see <a href=#/DM/mouse>mouse handling</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>Call object.MouseDrag(over_object,src_location,over_location,src_control,over_control,params).
</dl>

<p>This is called while dragging an object by pressing and holding the left
mouse button over the object and moving the mouse.  The over_object may be
null if dragging over a stat panel or over other empty space.

<p>Don't define this unless you need it, because it generates extra
communication that is otherwise avoided.  Most operations can be done through
Click(), DblClick(), and MouseDrop().  The other procedures are simply
available for completeness.

<p>The argument format for this verb is:

<xmp>
MouseDrag(src_object as null|atom in usr.client,\
          over_object as null|atom in usr.client,\
          src_location as null|turf|text in usr.client,\
          over_location as null|turf|text in usr.client,\
          src_control as text, over_control as text, params as text)
</xmp>
