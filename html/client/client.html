<p>Each connected player has a corresponding client object.  It has
variables and procedures which control aspects of player input/output.  This
object is also responsible for linking the player up to a mob.

<p>The client can be reassigned from its original mob M to a new mob N by
setting N.client = M.client.  This process disconnects the player from M
(calling M.Logout()) and connects the player to N (calling N.Login()).
Setting the mob's key has the same effect.

<p>Additional vars, procs, and verbs may be added to the client in order to
give the player properties that are independent of the mob.
