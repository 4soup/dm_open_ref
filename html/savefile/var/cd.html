<a name=/savefile/var/cd>
<h2>cd var (savefile)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/savefile>savefile</a>
</dl>

<p>This is the path name of the current directory.  Setting it causes the
current directory to change.  (We are talking about the current
<em>database</em> directory inside the savefile.  It is not a
real directory on the filesystem.)  It is perfectly legal to change to a
non-existent directory.  This new directory will not be saved to disk unless
its buffer (or one of its children) is modified, however.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
var/savefile/F = new()  // temporary file

F.cd = "/MyDir/Icon"
F.cd = ".."    // change to /MyDir
F.cd = "Icon"  // change to /MyDir/Icon
</xmp>
