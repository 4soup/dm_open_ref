<p>Sometimes when transitioning between BYOND versions you'll want to keep a
savefile in a condition where it can be read by older versions. The
<tt>byond_version</tt> var tells it to avoid using newer savefile features
(unless forced to) above a certain build number. (The build number changes
more often than the BYOND version number.) A value of 0 means not to
worry about it.

<p>This can be changed on a per-savefile basis so that you can use newer
features in some files and avoid changing others. For instance, character
saves might want to go on using older features for a while, but for saving
parts of the map you might prefer to allow newer features to be used.

<p>The default savefile compatibility version can be set at compile-time:

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
savefile/byond_build = 1600  // do not use savefile features from BYOND build 1601 onward
</xmp>
