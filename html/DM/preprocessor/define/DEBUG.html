<h2>DEBUG definition</h2>

<dd>#define DEBUG
</dl>

<p>If <code>DEBUG</code> is defined, source file and line number information
will be stored in the compiled <code>.dmb</code> file.  If a proc crashes
during execution and <code>DEBUG</code> information is present, the current
source file name and line number will be indicated in the error output.

<p>This option increases the size of the <code>.dmb</code>, typically by about
10%.  Execution of the code may also be a tiny bit slower.

<p>If you are distributing the <code>.dmb</code> to players and you do not
want them to have debug access at runtime, you should <em>not</em> compile in
debug mode.

<p>If you want to use the run-time profiler (see the debugging options in
Dream Seeker), you must compile in debug mode.  Then you can get a report of
CPU usage by your various procs.
