<h2>__MAIN__ macro</h2>

<p>The __MAIN__ macro is defined in the main <code>.dme</code> file being
compiled.  In all other files included by this file, __MAIN__ is not defined.

<p>The purpose of this is for library writers to package a small demo of their
library directly in the library source code.  When users compile the library
directly, the library's own <code>.dme</code> is the main file and can include
extra files that are not normally part of the library.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
#ifdef __MAIN__
#include "demo.dm"
#include "demo.dmm"
#endif
</xmp>

<p>If the demo requires a lot of extra resources, it is probably better to
package the demo as a separate project.  Small demos, however, are nice and
convenient using this "auto-demo" technique&mdash;especially since Dream
Seeker automatically launches Dream Maker after installing a library
containing a <code>.dme</code> file.
