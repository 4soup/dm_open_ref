<h2>comment</h2>

<p>Comments may be used to explain code.  They can also be used to turn off a
line or block of code.  All text inside a comment is ignored by the compiler.

<p>The single line comment begins with <code>//</code> and runs to the end of
the line.

<p>The multi-line comment begins with <code>/*</code> and runs until
<code>*/</code>.

<p>Multi-line comments may be nested.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
  // single line comment
  /*
     multi-line comment
  */
</xmp>
