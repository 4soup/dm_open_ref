<p>Special characters may be inserted into text using HTML syntax.  Such
characters are known as entities.  They start with an ampersand and end with a
semicolon.  The main reason for doing this is to insert characters that
otherwise have a special meaning.  The most common entities have names.  The
rest must be referred to by their Unicode character number (e.g.
<tt>&amp;#38;</tt> is the same as <tt>&amp;amp;</tt>).  The common ones are
listed in the following table. Note that the same effect may be achieved by
simply escaping the special character (like <code>\&lt;</code>).  The full
entity syntax is included for generality.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Entity</th>       <th>Character</th></tr></thead>
<tbody class=code>
<tr><td>&amp;amp;</td>    <td>&amp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;lt;</td>     <td>&lt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;gt;</td>     <td>&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;quot;</td>   <td>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;copy;</td>   <td>&copy;</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>When using numbered entities, you can put an <tt>x</tt> in front of the
number to use hexadecimal. For instance <tt>&amp;#x26;</tt>, <tt>&amp;#38;</tt>,
and <tt>&amp;amp;</tt> are all equivalent.
