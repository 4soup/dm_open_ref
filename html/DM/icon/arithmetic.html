<p class=performance>Note: The following "arithmetical" methods of icon
manipulation are being phased out in favor of the
<a class=code href=#/icon> /icon</a> object, which can be directly manipulated
and which provides a wider variety of operations. Many of those in turn have
been obviated by the <a class=code href=#/atom/var/color>color</a> and
<a class=code href=#/atom/var/transform>transform</a> vars.

<p>There are several ways in which icons can be manipulated at runtime.
They can be rotated, added together, and the colors components may be
altered.

<p>One purpose for such operations is to make players look different.  Other
interesting uses (and abuses) will undoubtedly follow.

<h3>Addition and Subtraction</h3>

<p>The result of adding two icons is an arithmetic combination of the color
components of each individual pixel.  At positions where either icon is
transparent, the result is also transparent.  Subtraction, instead of
increasing the intensity, decreases it by the amount in each pixel of the
icon being subtracted.

<p>Suppose you wanted to add together different bodies and heads.  You could
do that by making a few of each type with black backgrounds.  When these add
together, the black contributes nothing but prevents pixels in the other
icon from getting clipped.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb
   addicon(I as icon)
      icon += I
   subicon(I as icon)
      icon -= I
</xmp>

<p>If you need to add the same color to every pixel, you can do so using a
color value.  Color values have the same format as in HTML: "#RRGGBB" with
two hexadecimal digits for each color component.  That gives you a range in
color from 0 to FF (which is 255 in decimal).

<p>You can also specify a color value as "#RGB".  The single digit is
automatically repeated, so "#F00" is the same as "#FF0000", which is bright
red.  For certain pre-defined color values, you can also specify a name,
such as "red".  See <a href=#/{{appendix}}/html-colors>HTML colors</a> for a
list of color names.

<p>If you prefer base 10, you can create color values with the rgb(R,G,B)
instruction.  Each parameter is in the range 0 to 255.

<h3>Multiplication</h3>

<p>To increase (or decrease) the intensity of an icon multiplicatively, you
can use the '<code>*</code>' operator.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/multicon(factor as num)
   icon *= factor
</xmp>
