<p>At runtime, data objects are garbage collected.  That means data which
is no longer in use gets automatically deleted to free up system memory.
This applies to text strings, lists, savefiles, datum objects, and so on.

<p>The garbage collector works by using an efficient reference counting
system.  Once an item is no longer referenced by any variable, it gets
deleted.  For the most part, that frees you from having to think about memory
allocation, which is wonderful, especially in the case of text strings, which
tend to be allocated on the fly all over the place.

<p>There are a couple provisos that you should note.  One is that circular
references will never be deleted by the garbage collector.  By <em>circular
reference</em>, I mean a pair of objects with variables that point to each
other, or even an object with a variable that points to itself.  In rare
cases, you may even depend on this behavior.  When you are done with such
objects, you should either null out the circular reference, or you should
forcibly destroy each object with the <code>del</code> instruction.

<div class="sidebar underhood">
<p>This is a quick list of things that count as references to an object:
<ul>
<li>Stored in a var</li>
<li>An item in a <a href=#/list>list</a>, or <a href=#/list/associations>associated</a> with a list item</li>
<li>Has a <a class=code href=#/datum/var/tag>tag</a>
<li>Is on the map (always true for <a href=#/turf>turfs</a>)</li>
<li>Inside another atom's <a class=code href=#/atom/var/contents>contents</a></li>
<li>Inside an atom's <a class=code href=#/atom/var/vis_contents>vis_contents</a></li>
<li>A temporary value in a still-running proc</li>
<li>Is a <a href=#/mob>mob</a> with a <a class=code href=#/mob/var/key>key</a></li>
<li>Is an <a href=#/image>image object</a> attached to an atom</li>
</ul>
<p><tt>del()</tt> will try to clear out the most obvious possible references
first, and bail out when it's done, but if there are still references it will
search everywhere for any references that remain.
</div>

<p>An object with running or sleeping procs is referenced by the
<code>src</code> variable of those procs and will therefore not be thrown out.

<p>Another note is that the <code>world.contents</code> list does not count as
a reference.  Otherwise, <tt>/mob</tt> and <tt>/obj</tt> objects would never
be deleted, which is not the case.  Note that objects which are contained by
another object or which contain objects themselves <em>are</em> referenced and
will not be deleted.  That means an object must be at <code>loc=null</code>
with no contents and, of course, no other references anywhere in order to get
deleted by the garbage collector.

<p>Mobs with a non-empty <tt>key</tt> and all objects with non-empty
<tt>tag</tt> are also immortal.

<p>Turfs and areas do not currently get garbage collected.

<p>When the world shuts down, all objects are destroyed, whether they are
referenced or not.  You don't have to worry about system memory getting
consumed by persistent objects.  That doesn't happen.

<p>In general, people who do not like reference counting garbage collection
should be happy that DM provides a <code>del</code> instruction, allowing you
to take charge and delete things whether they are referenced or not.  Another
nicety is that this automatically nulls out any existing references to the
object, so you don't end up with dangling references to a deleted object,
which can otherwise be a great source of instability and mysterious bugs.
