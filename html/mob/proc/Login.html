<dl><dt><b>When:</b>
<dd>Called when a player's client tries to connect to a mob.  This is called
    by default from client.New(), when the player logs into the world.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>If the mob has no location, place it near (1,1,1) if possible.  Change
     the player's stat object (client.statobj) to the mob.
</dl>

<p>One can typically tell if a player is connecting to a fresh mob versus
reconnecting to an existing one by testing if the mob's location is null.
