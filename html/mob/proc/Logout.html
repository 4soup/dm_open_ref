<dd>Logout()
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>When:</b>
<dd>Called when a player's client has disconnected from a mob.  This happens
    in client.Del() when the player logs out of the world.  It may also
    happen when the player switches from one mob to another.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>None.
</dl>

<p>One may wish to distinguish between a player who has disconnected from
the game and one who is simply switching from one mob to another.  In the
case of a player switching to another mob, by the time <code>Logout()</code>
is called, the original mob's key will be null, whereas the key will still
be non-null in the case of a player disconnecting from the game.
