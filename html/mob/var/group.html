<p>This is a list of mobs in the same group.  By default, a mob will swap
positions with another mob in its group if bumped.  It is also possible to
make verbs that are accessible only to members of the group.

<p>The following example handles addition of somebody else to your group.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/join(mob/M)
   usr.group.Add(M)    // add M to usr's group
   view() << "[usr] joins [M]."
mob/verb/disband(mob/M)
   usr.group.Remove(M) // remove M from group
   view() << "[usr] disbands [M]."
</xmp>

<p>Note that group lists may be asymmetric.  Mob A may have mob B in his group
list, but mob B may or may not.  It is up to you to define whether mobs are
added into both lists or not.

<p>Here is an example of a verb accessible to a group:

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/summon()
   set src in usr.group
   loc = usr.loc
   view() << "[usr] summons [src]."
</xmp>
