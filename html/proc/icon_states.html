<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>A list of text strings.

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Icon: the icon being accessed
<dd>mode: applies to icons larger than one tile when using map_format=TILED_ICON_MAP; see below
</dl>

<p>Icons may have one or more internal states, which are identified by name.
The state "" is the default.

<p>If you are not using the TILED_ICON_MAP value for world.map_format, you
can ignore the mode argument.

<p>When graphics bigger than world.icon_size are used as an icon, and the
map_format in use is TILED_ICON_MAP, they are internally broken up into
tiles, one per icon state. The <tt>mode</tt> argument was added for big
icons that get split into several smaller tiles. Those icons have several
smaller states per true icon_state. For example if your 64&times;64 icon
has a state named "open", it will contain states "open", "open 0,0",
"open 1,0", "open 0,1", and "open 1,1" which are all used internally.
(If the state name is blank, the sub-states are just "0,0", etc.) When using
the TILED_ICON_MAP format, you need these for displaying the icon over
several different atoms.

<p>mode=0 will only show the sub-states ("open 0,0" and so on), all of which
can be safely extracted in a single-tile icon via the <tt>icon()</tt> proc.
mode=1 will show the main state names ("open"); any time you work with that
state name you're working with the full-size icon. mode=2 will show all of
the states.
