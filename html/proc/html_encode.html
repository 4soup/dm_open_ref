<p>Special characters such as &lt; and &gt; are not displayed literally in
html and may produce garbled output.  If you want to ensure that an entire
text string is displayed literally, you can "escape" those characters.  For
example, &lt; is produced by the code <code>&amp;lt;</code> and &gt; is
produced by the code <code>&amp;gt;</code>.

<p>The <code>html_encode()</code> instruction does this for you
automatically.  If you wanted to disallow html input from players, you
could use this to force their text to be displayed literally:

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/say(T as text)
   view() << "[usr] says, '[html_encode(T)]'"
</xmp>

<p>If a URL is included in the text, special characters like &amp; that are
part of the URL will be skipped. This keeps automatically created links in
the output from being broken.

<p>Note for BYOND oldies: the old-style formatting codes such as "\red" which
are still parsed but not encouraged are completely stripped out by
html_encode().
