<a name=/proc/alert>
<h2>alert proc</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/proc/input>input proc</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>alert(Usr=usr,Message,Title,Button1="Ok",Button2,Button3)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>Selected button
</dl>

<p>This sleeps the current proc until the user clicks one of the named
buttons.  As with input(), the first argument may be entirely left out.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/self_destruct()
   alert("Prepare to die.")
   del usr
</xmp>

<p>A slightly more complicated example provides the user with a choice in
the matter:

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/self_destruct()
   switch(alert("Would you like to die?",,"Yes","No","Maybe"))
      if("Yes")
         del usr
      if("No")
         usr << "You have second thoughts."
      if("Maybe")
         usr << "You flip a coin..."
         if(rand(0,1))
            usr << "Heads -- you lose."
            del usr
         else
            usr << "Tails -- you win!"
</xmp>
