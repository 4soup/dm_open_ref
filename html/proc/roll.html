<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>

</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>roll(ndice=1,sides)
<dd>roll(dice)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The sum of the rolled dice.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>ndice: number of dice to role.
<dd>sides: number of sides to the dice.
<dd>dice: a text string encoding both ndice and sides (see below).
</dl>

<p>The sides of the dice are numbered 1 through the total number of sides
and each is equally likely.

<p>An alternate form takes the dice parameters in a single text value such
as "3d4".  This may be useful when you want to store the dice information in
a single variable.  You can even specify an offset, such as "3d4+5".  That
adds 5 to the sum of 3 dice having 4 sides each.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
obj/potion/healing
  var/dice = "3d6"
  verb/drink()
    var/h = roll(dice)
    if(h>15) usr << "Very refreshing!"
    else usr << "You feel better."
</xmp>
