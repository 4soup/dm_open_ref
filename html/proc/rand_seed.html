<p>Many DM procedures make use of a pseudo-random number generator.  You can
use rand_seed() to initialize the generator.  The sequence returned by the
generator is identical each time it is initialized with the same seed, so you
could use this to reproduce the same output from an algorithm that uses the
random number generator.  If you never call rand_seed(), the generator is
initialized with a seed from the system clock, so it is effectively random.

<p>Note that with multiple realtime algorithms making calls to the generator
at unpredictable times, you are likely not to get the same result even when
using the same seed.  The overall sequence will be the same, but individual
sub-components of your world might call it in a different order.

<p>The pseudo-random number generator is system dependent, so do not expect
the sequence generated from a particular seed to be identical on two different
machines or operating systems.
