<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>startup(File,Port=0,Options,...)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>File: The dmb file to run in a new server or null to load the current world.
<dd>Port: The network port to start the new server on.  A value of 0
          indicates that any available port should be used.
<dd>Options: Any number of the options listed below.  Each option should be
             in an argument by itself.  If the option takes a parameter, this
             can be in the same argument or in the following one.
</dl>

<h3>The valid options are:</h3>
<dl>

<dt>-once
<dd> automatically shuts down the server when all players have logged off.

<dt>-close
<dd>Closes the child copy of DreamDaemon after the world it is running shuts
down.

<dt>-log &lt;logfile&gt;
<dd>sends all server output to the specified file.  The path to the file is
relative to the world directory (the path containing the world
<code>.dmb</code> file).

<dt>-logself
<dd>is identical to "-log [YourWorldFile].log".

<dt>-safe
<dd>runs the server in a special protective mode.  The server may only
access files in the same directory (or below) as the dmb file and access to
the shell() command is disabled.  This is the default mode if no security
setting is specified and the world is run from a directory by the same name
as the dmb file.

<dt>-home &lt;path&gt;
<dd>runs with the specified "safe home" directory.  Normally, in safe mode
the directory containing the world dmb file is the safe home.

<dt>-ultrasafe
<dd>like -safe, this prohibits all file access.  This is the default if no
security mode is specified and the world is not run from a directory with
the same name.

<dt>-trusted
<dd>allows full access to files on the computer and to the shell() command.
Note that this does not bypass the normal security of the operating system.
For example, in the UNIX operating system, all of the usual access
restrictions apply.  This mode merely removes BYOND's built-in safety checks.

<dt>-params &lt;paramtext&gt;
<dd>this is for passing user-defined parameters to the world.  Multiple
parameters may be packed into a single argument or -params may be used
several times.  In either case, the parameters are all loaded into
world.params when the world starts up.  The parameter format is
"name1=value1&name2=value2&...".

<dt>-quiet
<dd>disables the server's normal output indicating the BYOND version number
and network port.

<dt>-nologdates
<dd>disables automatic date/time output in the log.

<dt>-CGI
<dd>runs the world as a CGI program (to be executed by a web server).  A
/client object is automatically created for the user and any output sent to
the associated mob gets returned to the user's web browser.  This option is
normally specified in the compile-time setting:
<a href=#/world/var/executor>world.executor</a>, which is automatically
initialized for you if you include <code>html/CGI.dm</code> from the html
library.

<dt>-suid &lt;path&gt;
<dd>runs the world as the owner of the specified directory or path.  This only
works if DreamDaemon is running as root on operating systems where there even
is such a thing.

<dt>-suidself
<dd>runs the world as the owner of the world dmb file.  This only works if
DreamDaemon is running as root on operating systems where there even is such a
thing.

<dt>-cd &lt;path&gt;
<dd>runs with the specified working directory.  Normally, the directory
containing the world dmb file is used.

<dt>-port P
<dd>sets the network port to P.  The port may also be specified as a
positional argument (following the .dmb name).

<dt>-ports &lt;list&gt;
<dd>restricts the range of ports that DreamDaemon and any child worlds may
use.  The syntax of <i>list</i> is a comma separated list of ports or ranges
of ports.  Example: <code>-ports 1234,1236,1240-1250</code>.

<dt>-ip &lt;address&gt;
<dd>sets the IP address of the server. This will only work for an IP address
the system recognizes as one it can use for hosting. Accepts numerical
addresses only.

<dt>-webclient
<dd>Enables the webclient, overriding default behavior.

<dt>-nowebclient
<dd>Disables the webclient, overriding default behavior.

<dt>-verbose
<dd>Runtime errors will continue outputting details after a certain number of
errors has been reached. Without this option, the number of errors that
provide detailed info (such as call stack) is limited. Use this option with
caution as it could fill up a log file quickly if a problem occurs.

</dl>


<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The address of the new server in the form ip:port.
