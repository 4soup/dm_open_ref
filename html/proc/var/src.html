<h2>src var (proc)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>

<dd><a href=#/proc>procs</a>

</dl>

<p>This is a variable equal to the object containing the proc or verb.  It
is defined to have the same type as that object.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
obj/bread
  verb/eat()
    world << "[usr] eats [src]"
</xmp>

<p>If a player named "Bob" calls "eat bread", the output will be "Bob eats
the bread."

<p>Note that <tt>src</tt> has no meaning for global procs, derived from
<tt>/proc</tt>, unless they are invoked as verbs (by being attached to a
<a href=#/atom/var/verbs>verb list</a>).
