<dd><a href=#/operator/%3c%3c/output>&lt;&lt; output operator</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>Player &lt;&lt; load_resource(File)
<dd>Player &lt;&lt; load_resource(File, KeepTime)
<dd>Player &lt;&lt; load_resource(File1, File2..., KeepTime1, File3, File4..., KeepTime2...)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Player: A mob or client, a list of them, or world
<dd>File: A resource file (image or sound)
<dd>KeepTime: Minimum time (in seconds) to keep the file loaded; 0=default, -1=forever
</dl>

<p>Tells the player's client (or multiple players) to load the specified
resources now, and how long to keep them. If you do not specify a keep time, 0
is used which will use the default time.

<p>This may be useful for loading sounds into memory before they play, or to
load an icon as soon as possible even if it hasn't been displayed yet. This
can avoid delays later on when the resources are needed.

<p>Dream Seeker keeps most assets loaded for at least 5 minutes (300 seconds)
after their  last use. However if you think a more appropriate time is closer
to half an hour, you can set a keep time of 1800 seconds. Or if you want them
to stay loaded indefinitely, set a keep time of -1.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/Login()
    ..()
    // load up these songs now and keep them loaded indefinitely
    src << load_resource('music1.ogg', 'music2.ogg', 'music3.ogg', -1)
</xmp>

<p>In cases of extreme memory duress, Dream Seeker's garbage collector will
get more aggressive and can still override your choices if need be.
