<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>

</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>log(X,Y)
<dd>log(Y)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The logarithm (base X) of Y.  If X is not specified, a natural logarithm
is computed (base 2.718...).
</dl>

<p>The logarithm is the power to which you have to raise X in order to get
Y.  In other words, the following is true (ignoring round-off error):

<xmp>
X ** log(X,Y) == Y
</xmp>

<p>One nice property of this function is that it gradually increases, with a
slope that continuously tapers off.  In other words, it can be useful to
represent diminishing returns from some input, such as money, experience
points, and so forth.
