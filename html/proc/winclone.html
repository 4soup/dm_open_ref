<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>winclone(player, window_name, clone_name)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>player: A mob or client.
<dd>window_name: The name of a window, pane, menu, or macro set in the world's skin file.
<dd>clone_name: The name of the new window, pane, menu, or macro set to create.
</dl>

<p>Creates a clone of a window, pane, menu, or macro set that exists in the
world's skin file. The original object as it exists in the skin file (not its
current state) is used as a template to build the clone. The clone will exist
only for the player you choose.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
winset(usr, "templatewindow", "clonedwindow")
</xmp>

<p>If a window is not visible by default, it will have to be shown with
<tt>winset()</tt> or <tt>winshow()</tt>. A pane may be shown by using it in a
Child or Tab control. Menus or macros must be assigned to a window with
<tt>winset()</tt> before they will work.

<p>If window_name is "window", "pane", "menu", or "macro", and the skin file
does not have a control of that name already, the proc will create a new
control of that type from scratch.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
winclone(usr, "menu", "newmenu")
winset(usr, "newmenu_file", "parent=newmenu;name=File")
winset(usr, "newmenu_quit", "parent=newmenu_file;name=Quit;command=.quit")
</xmp>

<p>A new window is invisible by default. For windows and panes, you should
give them a size with <tt>winset()</tt> before adding any controls so you can
set their anchors properly.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
// Create the pane
winclone(usr, "pane", "newpane")
// Give it a size so we can figure out where to put controls
winset(usr, "newpane", "size=100x100")
// Add controls
winset(usr, "newpane_label", \
       "parent=newpane;pos=0,0;size=100x100;anchor1=0,0;anchor2=100,100")
// Put the pane in a child control where it can be seen
winset(usr, "a_child", "left=newpane")
usr << output("New label", "newpane_label")
</xmp>

<p>Once a clone is created, it can be deleted via a <tt>winset()</tt>
call:</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
winset(usr, "clonedwindow", "parent=none")
</xmp>
