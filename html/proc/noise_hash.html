<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>noise_hash(num1, num2, num3...)
<dd>noise_hash(list_of_nums)
<dd>noise_hash(hash_name, num1, num2, num3...)
<dd>noise_hash(hash_name, list_of_nums)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>A number between 0 and 1 (excluding 1 itself)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>num1, num2, num3...: Numbers to be hashed (at least one)
<dd>list_of_nums: A list containing the numbers to hash
<dd>hash_name: A text string indicating the hash type (reserved for future use)
</dl>

<p>For some games using concepts of procedural generation, it's nice to be
able to reliably create pseudo-random numbers in a repeatable, reliable way.
This proc takes all the numbers put into it and hashes them together to get
a value from 0 to 1. That output value will be the same for any given set of
input numbers. This can be used on its own or as part of a more in-depth
noise algorithm.

<p>If the first argument is a string, that may be used in future versions to
specify the type of hash to use. For now it is not used.

<p>Non-numbers provided to the proc will be interpreted arbitrarily. Don't do
that.
