<h2>flist proc</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/proc/fexists>fexists proc</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>flist(Path)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Path: The path in the filesystem to get a listing of.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>A list of files contained in the specified directory and whose names
     begin with the specified text.  The names of sub-directories are listed
     too, and are marked by a trailing "/".
</dl>

<p>The path is of the form "dir1/dir2/.../file".  Only files beginning with
the "file" part are listed, so be sure to end a directory name with "/" if
you wish to see its contents.  Otherwise you will just get that directory
name back with a "/" appended.

<p>Only files and sub-directories directly contained in the specified path
are listed (ie not the contents of the sub-directories too).  The file names
in the list do not include the path information but just the bare file name.
