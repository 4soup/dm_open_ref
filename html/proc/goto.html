<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>goto node
</dl>

<p>Jump to the specified node in the current proc.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
goto End
world << "ERR"
End
world << "The end"
</xmp>

<p>This displays "The end".

<p>Note: <tt>goto</tt> should be used judiciously. It's easy to fall into the
trap of "spaghetti logic" where <tt>goto</tt> is relied on so much that it
becomes too difficult to follow how the flow of code execution will proceed.
Normally, you'll want to use a construct like <tt>while()</tt> or
<tt>for()</tt> loops, and <tt>break</tt> and <tt>continue</tt> statements.
<tt>goto</tt> is for more complex situations that aren't readily handled by
any of these.
