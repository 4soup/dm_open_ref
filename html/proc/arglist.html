</dl>

<p>Normally, if you were to pass a list directly to a procedure, it would only
come through as a singe argument to that procedure.  In some cases, you might
instead want the items in the list to become the arguments to the procedure.
That is what <code>arglist()</code> achieves.

<p>If the items in the list are associations, these are treated as
<a href=#/proc/arguments/named>named arguments</a>.  Each such list item is
matched against the names of the procedure arguments and its associated value
is assigned to that parameter.

<p>Most built-in DM instructions do not support use of
<code>arglist()</code>, but all user-defined procedures automatically
support it.  The built-in instructions which support named arguments will also
support <code>arglist()</code>.

<p>The following example shows how to use <code>arglist()</code> with both
positional parameters and named arguments.  Both of these examples could be
replaced by a much simpler direct call without need for a list to hold the
arguments; this is just to illustrate the syntax.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
proc/MyProc(a,b)
   usr << "MyProc([a],[b])"

mob/verb/test()
   var/lst = list(1,2)
   MyProc(arglist(lst))  //MyProc(1,2)

   lst = list(b=2,a=1)   //just to illustrate that order does not matter
   MyProc(arglist(lst))  //MyProc(b=2,a=1)  -->  MyProc(1,2)
</xmp>
