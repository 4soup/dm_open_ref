<p>Returns a file object corresponding to the named file.  This file object
can then be used in a variety of ways.  One would be to send it to a player to
view using the browse() instruction.  Output may also be appended to the file
using the << operator.

<p>Note that the file exists in the external filesystem (ie the hard disk)
and not the cache.  That means the path is specified in double quotes and
will be evaluated at run-time rather than compile-time.  The file need not
exist at compile time and may even be modified at a later date.  This is the
principle reason for using a file in the filesystem rather than a cached
resource file (specified in single quotes).

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/help()
  usr << browse(file("help.html"))
</xmp>

<p>Many DM instructions that deal with files treat file("name") and "name" the
same.  There are cases such as browse() where a simple text string is not
interpreted as a filename; it is in those situations where file() is really
necessary.
