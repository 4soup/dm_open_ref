<p>This is similar to link() but instead of a URL, you can pass a file to be
viewed directly.  The file may be a cache file or an external file.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/var/picture = 'mob.jpg'
mob/verb/view_pic(mob/M as mob in view())
  usr << run(M.picture)

mob/verb/set_pic(F as file)
  usr.picture = F
</xmp>

<p>This example defines a picture to be associated with each mob and a verb
for viewing another mob's picture.  Players can also configure their own
pictures.
