<h2>ckeyEx proc</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/proc/ckey>ckey proc</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>ckeyEx(Text)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Text: The text string to convert to case-sensitive canonical key form.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The same text stripped of all punctuation and space.  Unlike, ckey(),
    case is preserved as are the '-' and '_' characters.
</dl>

<p>The true canonical form of a key is in all lowercase, but occasionally,
it is nice to preserve case when stripping a key (or other text) of any
special characters.

<p class=compatibility>Note: This proc used to be named <tt>cKey</tt>, like
<tt>ckey</tt> but with a capital k. To avoid confusion it has been renamed,
but old code will still compile with a warning.
