<h2>pick proc</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/proc/prob>prob proc</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>pick(Val1,Val2,...)
<dd>pick(List)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>One of the given values randomly chosen.
</dl>

<p>Randomly chooses an item from a list or from the arguments provided. If
only one argument is included and it is a list, then the item is chosen from
that list.

<p>When not using the list form, you can make a particular value more or less
likely to be chosen by providing a relative probability like this:

<xmp>
prob(P); Val
  Or
P; Val
</xmp>

<p>A value for P of 200 makes it twice as likely as the norm, 50 half as
likely, and so on.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
obj/food
  verb/eat()
    usr << pick (
        "[usr] eats \a [src].",
      prob(50)
        "[usr] devours \a [src].",
      prob(25)
       "[usr] wolfs down \a [src]."
    )
    del(src)
</xmp>

<p>There is no analogous weighted format for the list version of this proc.
