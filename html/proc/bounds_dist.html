<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>bounds_dist(Ref, Target)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The distance, in pixels, between Ref's and Target's bounding boxes.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Ref:    A turf, obj, or mob.
<dd>Target: A turf, obj, or mob.
</dl>

<p>The value returned by bounds_dist() is the number of pixels that
the two objects would have to move closer together (if this is even
possible, of course) to be touching but not overlapping.

<p>A return value of 12 for instance means the two objects have a gap
of 12 pixels between them.

<p>A return value of 0 means the two objects are not overlapping, but
their bounding boxes touch.

<p>A return value of -2 means the two objects are overlapping by 2
pixels; they would have to move 2 pixels apart to separate.
