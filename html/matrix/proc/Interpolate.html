<dd>Interpolate(Matrix2, t)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Matrix2: Another matrix
<dd>t: The interpolation factor: from 0 (src) to 1 (Matrix2). Usually this is a value between 0 and 1.
</dl>

<p>Calculates and returns a new matrix between src and Matrix2. If t is 0.5,
then the result will be exactly halfway between both matrices.

<p>There are many ways to interpolate matrices. Whenever possible, DM will
interpolate by doing scaling and/or shearing first, then rotation, then
translation. This is done by trying to find the angle of rotation of each
matrix first; a rotation of 180Â° is counted as a flip rather than a rotation.

<p>It is not strictly necessary for t to be between 0 and 1. Using a value
out of bounds will extrapolate a matrix, continuing the change as far as t.
