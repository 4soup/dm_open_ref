</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>icon: an icon file or /icon object
<dd>icon_state: an optional text string, specifying a single icon state to load
<dd>dir: an optional direction to extract
<dd>frame: an optional animation frame to extract
<dd>moving: Non-zero to extract only movement states, 0 for non-movement states,
  or null (default) for both
</dl>

<p>You generally don't call this directly but via new().  The specified icon
file is loaded into memory for direct access and manipulation.

<p>If the icon state is not specified, all icon states are loaded.  Ditto for
the direction, animation frame, or preference for movement states.  Animation
frames are numbered from 1 and up, so frame=4 is the 4th frame.

<p>(Movement states are special versions of an existing icon_state with the
same name, but appear in the Dream Maker editor with an "M" indicator. These
states are used for animation when the atom using the icon_state moves from
one tile to the next; otherwise only the normal non-moving state is displayed.)

<p>The following contrived example, loads the EAST facing default icon state
"" from the user's icon file, rotates that a bit, and then creates a new icon
file for the user.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/test()
   var/icon/I = new(usr.icon,icon_state = "",dir = EAST)
   I.Turn(90)   //rotate clockwise 90 degrees
   usr.icon = I
</xmp>

<p>Note that merely displaying different icon states or directions can
generally be achieved without any icon manipulation, which is good, because it
saves quite a bit of overhead.  For example, the variables atom.icon_state and
atom.dir can be used to control how atom.icon is displayed, without any need
for generating a new icon file.
