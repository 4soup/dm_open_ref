<dd>Shutdown the world.

<p>When the world is destroyed, only the Del() proc of the <code>world</code>
object is called automatically.  If you want to delete any other objects, you
must do so from within <code>world/Del()</code>.  Once this procedure returns,
any other procedures which may still be executing are immediately aborted and
all objects are silently destroyed.

<p>To prevent accidental hangs during <code>world/Del()</code> from preventing
shutdown, a timeout is applied to any sleeping operations such as
<code>sleep</code>, <code>world.Export()</code>, and so on.  If the total time
slept exceeds the timeout, <code>world/Del()</code> is aborted.  Currently,
this timeout is set at 30 seconds.
