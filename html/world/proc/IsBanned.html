<dd>IsBanned(key,address,computer_id,type)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>True value if user is banned from this world.  This may be a list, in which case special meaning is attributed to certain list elements as described below.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>key: BYOND key of the user.
<dd>address: current IP address of the user.
<dd>computer_id: current computer_id of the user if known.
<dd>type: type of connection if known (see <a href=#/client/var/connection>client.connection</a>)
</dl>

<p>By default, this procedure checks the "ban" configuration file.  If an
entry is found for the current world (based on the value of world.hub), the
parameter text is converted into a list (using params2list()), and the result
is returned.  Otherwise, null is returned.

<p>A ban that applies to all worlds on the host's computer will not call
IsBanned(). The connection will simply be denied.

<p>This procedure is called internally whenever a new user connects (before
client/New() is called).  If the result is true, access is denied.  If you
want to ban a user but still allow them to log in (perhaps with reduced
functionality), you can put "Login=1" in the parameter text.  If you want to
display an explanation to the user about why they are banned, you can also put
"message=X" in the parameter text, where X is the message to display to the user.
A reason for the ban can be added with a "reason=X" field.  Of course, you can
also override IsBanned() and insert these values directly into the list that is
returned.

<h2>Example</h2>
<xmp>
world/IsBanned(key,address)
   . = ..()            //check the ban lists
   if(istype(., /list))
      .["Login"] = 1   //allow banned user to login
</xmp>

<p>When you ban people from paging you, this also causes them to be added to
the keyban list.  Even if they are already connected, IsBanned() will be
re-evaluated and acted upon at that time.  When you remove pager ban, they are
removed from keyban as well.

<p>Additional data elements may be added to the ban list in the future.
The current definition includes just the following items:

<dl>

<dt>Login
<dd>true if banned user should be allowed to log in

<dt>reason
<dd>text string describing the reason or origin of the ban.  For example, when
people are banned from the pager, they are added to the "keyban" list with
reason = "pager ban".  This text is internal information only and is not
displayed to the banned user.

<dt>message
<dd>text string explaining to the user why they were banned and possibly what
they should do to be forgiven.

</dl>

<p>Since the data in the "ban" file is in
<a href=#/proc/list2params>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</a> format, it is
probably not desirable to edit the file by hand.  No built-in facilities for
editing the file have been provided (aside from automatic addition of pager
bans), but an interface could be created, using <a href=#/world/proc/GetConfig>GetConfig</a>
and <a href=#/world/proc/SetConfig>SetConfig</a> to read and write the data.
Extra features could also be added such as automatic inference of key
associations by IP address.
