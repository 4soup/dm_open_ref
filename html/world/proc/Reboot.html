<dd></dl>

<p>Reload the world from scratch.  Any connected players will automatically
relogin.  This would be useful if you needed to recompile the world after
changing some code.

<p>In a UNIX environment, you can cause a running server to reboot by
sending it the signal SIGUSR1.

<p>If you override this proc, you must call ..() if you want the reboot to
complete normally.

<p>For reboots initiated by Dream Seeker, usr will be the mob belonging to
the player who sent the command.
