<p>Retrieves the number of available credits in a player's account. This
feature is intended for games that make use of the credit system, and for
security all such games must use a hub password.

<p>This proc will return null if there was no way to reach the hub. Use
isnull() to check for a null value. Contacting the hub may take a few
moments, so it is a good idea to use spawn() to avoid holding up the rest of
the game.

<p>The best time to call this proc is before a player does something that
would allow them to spend credits, and/or just afterward, so they can see
what is left in their account.

<p class=security>Note: You can specify a different hub path and hub_password
by adding these as extra arguments, but this is not recommended for security
reasons. If you use this feature, it should only be on games that cannot be
downloaded by the public.
