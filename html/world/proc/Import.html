<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>Import()
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The file sent by the remote server.  The file will be downloaded to the
     local server's resource cache.  Note that this will cause the caller to
     sleep while waiting for the necessary data to be transfered.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>When:</b>
<dd>Call this inside world.Topic() if you are expecting a file from the
     remote server.
</dl>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
//sending the file
mob/proc/Export(Addr)
  var/savefile/F = new()
  F.Write(src)
  world.Export(Addr,F)

//receiving the file
world/Topic()
  var/savefile/F = new(world.Import())
  F.Read() //read the mob
</xmp>

<p>This example defines a mob proc called Export() which writes the mob to a
savefile and sends it to another server (specified by Addr).  The remote
server opens it as a savefile and creates the mob (if the same mob type is
defined on both servers and mob.Read() is compatible with the sending
server's mob.Write()).

<p>Note that another method of transferring player mobs is to use the key
savefile (accessed by client.Export() and client.Import()).  Direct server
to server communication on the other hand could transfer data (like
non-players) without the need for player involvement at all.

<p>Savefiles are the most common type of file to transfer, but world.Import()
simply returns a reference to an item in the world's .rsc file, which could be
any type of file.  This particular example demonstrates how to open such a
file as a temporary savefile.  (It gets dumped from the cache into a separate
temporary file, which is then opened as a savefile.)  Other types of files
would be handled differently.  For example, you could use fcopy() to dump the
cached item to its own separate file.
