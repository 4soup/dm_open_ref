<p>The value of <tt>world.fps</tt> defines the speed of the world in frames
(server ticks) per second. By default this is 10 fps, which is a good speed if
all objects move in full tiles. Higher values yield smoother results, but at a
cost to performance. Timing of many events may be limited by the system clock,
so <tt>fps</tt> values beyond 40 or 50 may cause unwanted effects like jitter
even for projects that are not very demanding in terms of performance.

<p>For projects making use of pixel movement, higher <tt>fps</tt> is usually
desired. 40 seems to be a good value for general use, but in worlds that have
a large number of players, you may wish to lower the value and give players a
higher <tt>step_size</tt> per tick instead.

<p>This var exists for convenience; it is calculated by <tt>10 /
world.tick_lag</tt>. The value of <tt>world.tick_lag</tt> is actually more
accurate, but it is easier to think of world speed in terms of frames per
second. The actual tick rate has a resolution of 1 ms.

<p>When reading <tt>world.fps</tt>, the result is always given as a whole
number to gloss over rounding error.

<p>If you set <tt>client.tick_lag</tt> or <tt>client.fps</tt> to a value other
than 0, you can make the client tick at a different (usually faster) rate.
