<p>Setting this to 0 disables the very long loop protection.  By default,
loops in the code which undergo a very large number of iterations or
recursions are aborted (by crashing the proc).  This prevents the proc from
locking up the server for too long.

<p>You may need to disable this feature if your code has some very long loops
in it.  Before doing that, make sure it's not <em>infinitely</em> long!  Your
program will utterly crash if it runs out of system stack space, which can
happen in a very deep or infinite recursion.

<p>Note: The compiler will now generate a warning when you disable
<tt>loop_checks</tt>. It is not advisable to disable the check unless you're
trying to debug something, since you can cause the server to hang. Generally
if you have a loop so long it can cause the regular loop checks to freak out,
you need to make a change to the loop behavior anyway.
