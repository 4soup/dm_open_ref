<p>This controls whether the world advertises itself in the
<a href=http://www.byond.com/games/>BYOND Hub</a> when it has an open network
port for accepting players.  The visibility of the world still depends on
whether any of the connected players has their location reporter turned on,
and that in turn relies on the pager being turned on.
