<p>If you are distributing your game to players, you can use this variable
to automatically notify them of new releases.  To do so, you will first need
to set <a href=#/world/var/hub><code>world.hub</code></a> to the hub
path of your game.  You can then advertise the current version by
configuring that value in your
<a href=https://secure.byond.com/members/?command=edit_hub>hub console</a>.

<p>When players boot up an outdated version of your game (as indicated by
comparing <code>world.version</code> with the version advertised by BYOND
hub), they will be notified of the new release.
