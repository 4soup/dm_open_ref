<p>This is the network address of the machine hosting the world, as it is
seen by the outside network (from the Internet) and the hub.  If it cannot
be determined, it will be null.

<p>The full network address of the world may be formed by concatenating the
world address and port: "byond://[address]:[port]".

<p>This var exists because <tt>world.address</tt> may not be accurate if the
world is hosted on a machine behind a router using NAT. The value returned
by <tt>internet_address</tt> can be given to other players who wish to log
in.
