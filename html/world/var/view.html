<p>This is the default map viewport range.  The default value of 5 produces an
11x11 viewport.  A value of -1 turns off the map display altogether.  The client may automatically
scale down icons in order to conveniently fit the map on the player's screen.

<p>For non-square views, you can assign this to a text string of the form
"WIDTHxHEIGHT".  For example, "11x11" is equivalent to a view depth of 5, but
you could make it wider like this: "13x11".

<p>This setting also affects the default range of the <code>view()</code>,
<code>oview()</code>, <code>range()</code>, and <code>orange()</code>
procedures.

<p>If the entire map is small enough to fit on one screen 
(arbitrarily defined to be 21x21 or less),
the default <code>view</code> is automatically adjusted to fit the map.  In
this case, <code>client.lazy_eye</code> is also automatically turned on by
default, since you probably don't want the map to scroll around.
