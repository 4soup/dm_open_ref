<p>This is the network address of the machine hosting the world.  If it
cannot be determined, it will be null.

<p>The full network address of the world may be formed by concatenating the
world address and port: "byond://[address]:[port]".

<p>In CGI mode, this is the web address of the world.

<p>This is the local address only. If the world is hosted via a router, the
external IP address may be different. Use <tt>internet_address</tt> to find
the external address, if available.
