<p>This gives the amount of time (in 1/10 seconds) that the world has been
running.  In actual fact, it is the number of server ticks that have passed
multiplied by world.tick_lag.  Therefore if the server sleeps (when no
players are connected) this time is not counted.  Also, if the server runs
overtime during a tick (because procs take longer than tick_lag to finish)
this still only counts as one tick.  This value is therefore a measure of
"game time" rather than real time.
