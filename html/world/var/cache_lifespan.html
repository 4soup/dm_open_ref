<p>Number of days items that are not in use will be saved in the resource
cache (.rsc file).  Files uploaded by players are stored in the world's .rsc
file for future use.  If the file is not used for the specified amount of
time, it will be removed to save space.

<p>Setting this value to 0 causes items to be saved for the current session
only.  This is used by the CGI library, because web browsers cannot make use
of server-side caches when uploading files anyway.

<p>This value must be a whole number.
