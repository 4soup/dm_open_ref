<p>This is the smallest unit of time (one server tick) measured in 1/10
seconds.  The duration of events that take some finite amount of time (like
sleep) will be rounded to a whole number of ticks.

<p>Players are limited to one command (including movements) per server tick,
so this value can be used to adjust the responsiveness of the game.  If the
network is too slow to keep up with players, their commands will get queued
up, which can be annoying when trying to move.  In this case, tick_lag
should be increased so that the stored up movement commands are discarded.
On the other hand, if you have a very fast network, you may wish to decrease
tick_lag to speed up the response time to player commands.

<p>Often it is more convenient to set world.fps instead of world.tick_lag,
since fps (frames per second) is an easier way to think of server ticks.
world.tick_lag is 10 / world.fps and vice-versa, so a tick_lag of 0.25 is
equal to 40 fps.

<p>If you set client.tick_lag or client.fps to a value other than 0, you can
make the client tick at a different (usually faster) rate.
