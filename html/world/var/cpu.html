<p>This is the percentage of a server tick that the server spends processing
running procs and the work of sending map information to players.  A value of 0
would indicate very little cpu usage.  A value of 100 would indicate full cpu
usage, which could mean that the server cannot complete all the necessary
computations during a tick to finish in time for the next tick.  In this case,
timed events (such as sleep) may take
longer than requested.

<p>When deciding on a value for tick_lag, one could use this value to
determine if the CPU is fast enough to tick at a higher rate.

<p>The <tt>map_cpu</tt> var is a subset of this, measuring only time used for
sending map information.
