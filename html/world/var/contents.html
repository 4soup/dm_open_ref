<a name=/world/var/contents>
<h2>contents list var (world)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>

<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>List of all areas, turfs, mobs, and objs initially in the world.
</dl>

<p>This is a list of every object in the world.  Objects in this list are in
no particular order.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
proc/ListAreas(mob/M)
  var/area/A
  M << "Areas:"
  for (A in world.contents)
    M << A
</xmp>

<p>This example displays a list of every area in existence.  As a convenient
short-hand, one may simply write for(A) or for(A in world) instead of the
full for(A in world.contents).
