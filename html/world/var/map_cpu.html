<p>This is the percentage of a server tick that the server spends processing
information about the map to send to players.  A value of 0 would indicate very
little cpu usage.  A value of 100 would indicate full cpu usage, which means
that the server cannot complete all the necessary computations during a tick to
finish in time for the next tick.  In this case, timed events (such as sleep)
may take longer than requested.
