<p>Returns 1 if the world is currently hosted and the port can be reached by
players (as determined by the BYOND hub), 0 if not.

<p>If the port is not reachable, there may be a brief period during which the
hub is still attempting to make contact; during that time the port is assumed
to be reachable. Currently, the reachability test times out and fails after
30 seconds.
