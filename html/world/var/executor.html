<p>This option is for direct execution of <code>.dmb</code> files in UNIX.
The most common use is for writing CGI programs that are executed by the web
server.

<p>The first parameter in the <var>executor</var> text string is the path to
DreamDaemon.  The one listed above is the standard UNIX location.

<p>Optional parameters may follow.  The most common are -CGI and -logself.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
world/executor = "/usr/local/byond/bin/DreamDaemon -CGI -logself"
</xmp>

<p>This example creates a CGI program to be executed by a web server.  It
puts its error output in the file <code><var>projname</var>.log</code>.

<p>All of this is configured for you when you include
<code>html/CGI.dm</code> from the html library.
