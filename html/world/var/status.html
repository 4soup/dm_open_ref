<p>This is a short text string used in BYOND hub to describe the state of a
game in progress.  For example, you might want to indicate if new players
will be able to actively play, or whether they would have to join as
spectators.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
world
   status = "accepting players"
mob/verb/start_game()
   world.status = "accepting spectators"
   //...
</xmp>
