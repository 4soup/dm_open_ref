<p>This value says how the world will display maps. In a normal overhead
tiled map the value is <tt>TOPDOWN_MAP</tt> for the top-down format. For older
games that predate this feature, the value is <tt>TILED_ICON_MAP</tt>.

<p>If you use a map format other than top-down, the HUD will still use a
tile format like it would in top-down display. HUD objects are not projected
into whatever map_format you use and they are not affected by changing
client.dir. The size of the HUD is rounded up to the nearest number of full
screen tiles; the size of each tile is defined by world.icon_size.

<h3>Top-down format</h3>

(See more at <a href=#/{notes}/topdown>Topdown maps</a>.)

<p>This is the default map format. Icons are drawn in a tile form and viewed
from overhead. In this layout, the layer assigned to each atom is very
important. The number of tiles shown is set by client.view or world.view.

<p>Because this format is familiar and easy to understand, it is the default
setting. Most of the vars related to maps and atoms are designed and
documented with this format in mind.

<h3 deprecated=1>Tiled icon format</h3>

(See more at <a href=#/{notes}/tiled-icons>Tiled icons</a>.)

In BYOND 4.0 a new feature was introduced for using "big" icons, bigger than
the standard tile size, by splitting them up into states like "0,0", "1,0",
and so on. This functionality is no longer needed since BYOND now has the
ability to display icons in their natural size. Some games that were designed
before this, however, may still need to make use of this splitting feature
that breaks icons into smaller tile-sized pieces.

When an icon is broken into chunks, each state in the icon is given a
thumbail version of the full image, and then new states are added to show
each chunk. For instance if world.icon_size is the default 32&times;32, and
the icon is 64&times;64, then the "door" state would become a thumbnail of
the full door image while "door 0,0" (the lower left corner), "door 1,0",
"door 0,1", and "door 1,1" were created to show each smaller section of the
image. If the default "" state is broken into chunks, those chunks are just
named "0,0" and so on without a space.

<p class="note deprecated">This format is deprecated. It exists to support
older games and allow them to be compiled without causing them to break,
until they can be redesigned for one of the newer formats.

<h3>Isometric format</h3>

(See more at <a href=#/{notes}/isometric>Isometric maps</a>.)

<p>If map_format is set to <tt>ISOMETRIC_MAP</tt>, the map is displayed in
isometric form. Isometric tiles are displayed in a foreshortened diagonal
perspective, where the "north" direction actually displays as northeast on
the player's screen, and "east" shows up as southeast. The value of
<tt>client.view</tt> or <tt>world.view</tt> is used to calculate the
<i>minimum</i> number of tiles to display, and extra tiles to each side will
be shown to fill in the corners.

<p>In an isometric map, the tile width set in world.icon_size is the most
important factor. This should be a multiple of 4 for best results. The
minimum tile height is half that value, and any extra height is used to show
vertical structures that "stick up" off the map surface. When you draw an
isometric tile icon, start with a flattened diamond shape at the bottom that
is only half as high as it is wide.

<p>Isometric maps behave differently during drawing than top-down maps. In
isometric, tiles that are nearer to the viewer's perspective are drawn in
front of tiles farther back, regardless of layer. Layers only count within an
individual tile. This means that if you want to have a vertical structure
"stick up" to partially hide something behind it, the icon sticking up should
always be on a tile forward from the one being partly covered. E.g. if you
have a wall taking up part of your tile, it needs to be at the "back" end of
the tile to properly hide anything on the tiles behind it.

<p>The <tt>pixel_x</tt> and <tt>pixel_y</tt> values, <tt>step_x</tt> and
<tt>step_y</tt> values, and the gliding that happens when moving between
tiles, are based on the width set by <tt>world.icon_size</tt>. If you set
<tt>world.icon_size="64x128"</tt> to show tall buildings, only the 64 matters
for pixel offsets. Use <tt>pixel_w</tt> and <tt>pixel_z</tt> to adjust the
position of atoms (or the client) horizontally or vertically without respect
to <tt>client.dir</tt> or the map format.

<p>Note: Offsets for x and y also affect the layering order used to draw
the icons. Any object with a pixel offset onto another tile is considered
part of whichever tile is closer.

<p>If you use an icon wider than one tile, the "footprint" of the isometric
icon (the actual map tiles it takes up) will always be a square. That is, if
your normal tile size is 64 and you want to show a 128x128 icon, the icon is
two tiles wide and so it will take up a 2&times;2-tile area on the map. The
height of a big icon is irrelevant--any excess height beyond width/2 is used
to show vertical features. To draw this icon properly, other tiles on that
same ground will be moved behind it in the drawing order.

<p>One important warning about using big icons in isometric mode is that you
should only do this with dense atoms. If part of a big mob icon covers the
same tile as a tall building for instance, the tall building is moved back
and it could be partially covered by other turfs that are actually behind it.
A mob walking onto a very large non-dense turf icon would experience similar
irregularities.

<h3 byondver=482>Side-view format</h3>

(See more at <a href=#/{notes}/side>Side-view maps</a>.)

<p>The <tt>SIDE_MAP</tt> format is like a cross between <tt>TOPDOWN_MAP</tt>
and <tt>ISOMETRIC_MAP</tt>. It looks very similar to a top-down view but it is
intended for more of a 3/4 perspective, where tiles lower on the screen are
considered closer to the viewer. Because this impacts the way layers work,
most of the layering behavior is the same as with isometric.

<p>In a 3/4 perspective the tiles are often foreshortened, so pixel offsets
are adjusted to account for this. For example, you may set
<tt>world.icon_size</tt> to <tt>"32x24"</tt>, but the tile is considered to be
a perfect square if you look at it from the top down. Because the width is 32
pixels, the virtual height is also 32, so if you use pixel_y=32 the atom will
appear one tile further back than it normally is. (This adjustment doesn't
affect screen objects or <tt>pixel_w</tt>/<tt>pixel_z</tt>.)

<p>Changing <tt>client.dir</tt> preserves the same tile size regardless of
orientation.
