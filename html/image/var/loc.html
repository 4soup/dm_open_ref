<a name=/image/var/loc>
<h2>loc var (image)</h2>

<p>The location of an image specifies the object to which the image is
attached.  Unless the image drawing layer is specified, the default will make
it appear above this object, as though it were an overlay.

<p>Note that the image is not <em>inside</em> the specified location.  In
other words, this loc variable does not behave like /atom/movable/var/loc
which specifies the container object.  It is more like the image is on top of
the specified object.  If the object moves, the image will automatically move
around with it.
