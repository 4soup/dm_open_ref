<p>There are two types of movable atoms: objs and mobs. The difference between
them is that a mob can be attached to a human player, and is also typically
used for NPCs and creatures. The obj type is a little bit simpler and is
typically used for objects in the environment, items in inventory, etc.

<p>Objects are derived from <tt>/obj</tt>, which derives from
<tt>/atom/movable</tt>.

<p>The following example defines the obj type <tt>/obj/scooper</tt>.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
obj
  scooper
    desc = "Super pooper scooper."
</xmp>
