<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Start: The list position in which to begin the cut.
<dd>End: The list position immediately following the last element to be
     removed.
</dl>

<p>Remove the elements between list[Start] and list[End-1], decreasing the
size of the list appropriately.  The default end position of 0 stands for
the position immediately after the end of the list, so by default the entire
list is deleted.
