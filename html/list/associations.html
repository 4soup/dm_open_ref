<p>Each unique text string or object in a list may be associated with another
value.  This is done by using the item as an index into the list.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
var/params[0]

params["player"] = "James Byond"
params["score"] = 2000

//List now contains ("player","score")
//These are associated with ("James Byond",2000)

usr << "Looping through list items:"
var/p
for(p in params)
   usr << "[p] = [params[p]]"

usr << "Looping through array indices:"
var/i
for(i=1,i<=params.len,i++)
   p = params[i]
   usr << "[p] = [params[p]]"
</xmp>

<p>The above example illustrates the typical way in which list associations
are managed.  Note that an item in the list may be added by assigning its
associated value.  The example could have started by doing
<code>params.Add("player","score")</code>, but that would have been
redundant.

<p>Both <code>for</code> loops in the example have the same effect.  The
first one loops through each item in the list, and displays it along with
its associated value.  The second loop achieves the same thing by looping
through the numerical indices (referred to as <em>array</em> indices as
opposed to <em>associative</em> indices).

<p>Since numeric indices are treated differently, accessing the Nth item
in the list, you may not assign an associated value to a numeric list
item. Associations must have a text string or object reference as the index
item. (<tt>alist()</tt> is an exception to this, and can use numeric
associations. See <a class=code href=#/list/alist>alist()</a> for more
information.)

<p>Associated values default to null if none is assigned.  This is also the
value returned when the supplied index item does not exist in the list.  The
list defined above, for example, would return null for
<code>params["time"]</code>.

<p>The <a class=code href=#/proc/list>list()</a> or
<a class=code href=#/proc/alist>alist()</a> instructions may also be used to
create associative lists.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
var/list/lst = list("player" = "James Byond", "score" = 2000)
</xmp>

<p>When the index values happen to be text strings that satisfy all the
requirements for variable names, this may also be written in a convenient
short-hand:

<xmp>
var/list/lst = list(player = "James Byond", score = 2000)
</xmp>

<p>In other words, this is exactly the same syntax as for
<a href=#/proc/arguments/named>named arguments</a>.

<p>The <a href=#/proc/alist><tt>alist</tt> proc</a> creates lists that are
<i>strictly</i> associative. This means that list items are treated as "keys"
in key,value pairs. Unlike a regular list, each "key" is unique.
