<h2>Del proc (datum)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/proc/del>del proc</a>
<dd><a href=#/DM/garbage>garbage collection</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>Del()
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>When:</b>
<dd>Called when the object is destroyed, for example by using the
<code>del</code> instruction.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>Delete the object.  The contents of atomic objects are also destroyed at
this time, as though <code>del</code> were called on each one of them.
</dl>

<p>When the world is destroyed, the <tt>Del()</tt> proc is not automatically
called. The only object for which it is called is <a href=#/world>/world</a>.
If you need the <tt>Del()</tt> proc for a particular object to be called at
that time, you should explicitly call it from <tt>world/Del()</tt>.

<p>Note: <b>Always</b> call <tt>..()</tt> at the end of the proc if you
override it.
