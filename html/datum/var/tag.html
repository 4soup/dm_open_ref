<p>This may be assigned to a unique text string identifying a particular
object.  A reference to the object can then be obtained by using locate().

<p>One reason to use tags is when making references in the code to objects and
locations that will be created on the map.  You can simply edit the object in
the map editor, set its tag, and then use that in the code relating to the
object.

<p>The following example demonstrates how to set a tag and use it to obtain a
reference to an object.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/test()
	var/obj/O = new()
	O.tag = "My Object"

	var/obj/O2 = locate("My Object")

	ASSERT(O == O2) //this should always be true
</xmp>

<p>Setting a tag to "" or null removes it.  Any object with a non-empty tag is
immune to garbage collection, since the tag is treated as an implicit
reference to that object.
