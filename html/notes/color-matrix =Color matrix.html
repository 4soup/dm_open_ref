<p>A color matrix is used to transform colors, in the same way that a matrix
represented by the <tt>/matrix</tt> datum is used to transform 2D coordinates.
A transformation matrix is 3x3, of which only 6 values are needed because the
last column is always the same.  A color matrix, because it transforms four
different numbers instead of two, is 5x5.

<pre>
                |rr rg rb ra 0|
                |gr gg gb ga 0|
[r g b a 255] x |br bg bb ba 0| = [r' g' b' a' 255]
                |ar ag ab aa 0|
                |cr cg cb ca 1|
</pre>

<p>In easier-to-understand terms, this is how the result is calculated:

<xmp>
new_red   = red * rr + green * gr + blue * br + alpha * ar + 255 * cr
new_green = red * rg + green * gg + blue * bg + alpha * ag + 255 * cg
new_blue  = red * rb + green * gb + blue * bb + alpha * ab + 255 * cb
new_alpha = red * ra + green * ga + blue * ba + alpha * aa + 255 * ca
</xmp>

<p>It is helpful to think of each row in the matrix as what each component of
the original color will become. The first row of the matrix is the rgba value
you'll get for each unit of red; the second is what each green becomes, and so
on.

<p>Because the fifth column of the matrix is always the same, only 20 of the
values need to be provided.  You can use a color matrix with atom.color or
client.color in any of the following ways:

<dl class=codedd>
<dt>RGB-only (9 to 12 values)
<dd>list(rr,rg,rb, gr,gg,gb, br,bg,bb, cr,cg,cb)
<dt>RGBA (16 to 20 values)
<dd>list(rr,rg,rb,ra, gr,gg,gb,ga, br,bg,bb,ba, ar,ag,ab,aa, cr,cg,cb,ca)
<dt>Row-by-row (3 to 5 <tt>rgb()</tt> values, or null to use the default row)
<dd>list(red_row, green_row, blue_row, alpha_row, constant_row)
</dl>

<p>Reading a color var that has been set to a matrix will return the full
20-item list, where every 4 items represent a row in the matrix (without the
fifth column).

<p>In the <tt>MapColors()</tt> icon proc, the values are sent as arguments,
not as a list.
