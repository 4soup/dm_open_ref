<dd>threshold: Color threshold for bloom</dd>
<dd>size: Blur radius of bloom effect (see Gaussian blur)</dd>

<p>Post-processing effect that makes bright colors look like they're a strong
light source, spreading their light additively to other nearby pixels. This is
a complex effect that involves multiple shader passes. For both performance and
visual reasons, it is usually best applied to an entire plane rather than to
individual objects.

<p>The color <tt>threshold</tt> determines which pixels this effect applies to.
If any of the red, green, or blue components of the pixel are greater than the
same component for the threshold, that pixel will bloom. The blooming pixels
then have their colors spread outward to create a glow that gets added to the
original image.

<p>The <tt>offset</tt> and <tt>size</tt> parameters are used to control the
glow effect. They work the same as they do in the drop shadow filter:
<tt>offset</tt> causes the light to grow outwards, and a blur of <tt>size</tt>
is then applied to soften it. Often just using a blur alone will produce a
pleasing effect. By playing with these two values you can make the bloom effect
appear differently.

<p>The <tt>alpha</tt> value is applied to any light contributions from bloomed
pixels that get added to the original image, so values lower than 255 can make
the effect less pronounced. This can be very useful if you choose to animate
the filter.
