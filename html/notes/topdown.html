<p>By default, BYOND displays all maps in top-down format, so
<tt>world.map_format</tt> is set to <tt>TOPDOWN_MAP</tt> unless you say
otherwise. This view means players are looking down on the map, and
"north" corresponds to the top of their screen. (This can be changed by
setting <tt>client.dir</tt>.)

<p>A related map_format, used by older games, is <tt>TILED_ICON_MAP</tt>. This
is also topdown but it handles icons differently.

<p>In this form, the <tt>layer</tt> var behaves exactly as you would expect:
Icons with a lower layer are drawn beneath icons with a higher layer. The only
exception is when you use <a href=#/{notes}/big-icons>big icons</a>, which will
be drawn above any other icons on the same layer. Also an atom's underlays will
be drawn behind it unless their layer is changed, and its overlays will draw in
front of it unless otherwise stated.

<p>Topdown mode also guarantees that <tt>world.view</tt> or <tt>client.view</tt>
will set the exact screen size used by the HUD, except for HUD objects that
appear outside of the normal bounds.

<p>Screen objects (also called the HUD) cannot be intermixed with topdown
icons. They will appear on top of other icons, unless using a lower plane or a
special layer like <tt>BACKGROUND_LAYER</tt>.
