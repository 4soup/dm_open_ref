</dl>

<dl><dt>Args:</dt>
<dd>x: Horiztonal direction and period of wave</dd>
<dd>y: Vertical direction and period of wave</dd>
<dd>size: Maximum distortion in pixels (defaults to 1)</dd>
<dd>offset: Phase of wave, in periods (e.g., 0 to 1)</dd>
<dd>flags: Defaults to 0; see below for other flags</dd>
</dl>

<p>Applies a wave distortion effect to this image.

<p>The <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> parameters specify both the direction and
period of the wave; the period is <tt>sqrt(x*x + y*y)</tt>.

<p>This filter is meant to be animated, from whatever <tt>offset</tt> you want
to <tt>offset+1</tt>, and then repeating. With multiple waves, you can produce
a very convincing water effect.

<h3>Example</h3>
<xmp>
#define WAVE_COUNT 7
atom/proc/WaterEffect()
    var/start = filters.len
    var/X,Y,rsq,i,f
    for(i=1, i<=WAVE_COUNT, ++i)
        // choose a wave with a random direction and a period between 10 and 30 pixels
        do
            X = 60*rand() - 30
            Y = 60*rand() - 30
            rsq = X*X + Y*Y
        while(rsq<100 || rsq>900)   // keep trying if we don't like the numbers
        // keep distortion (size) small, from 0.5 to 3 pixels
        // choose a random phase (offset)
        filters += filter(type="wave", x=X, y=Y, size=rand()*2.5+0.5, offset=rand())
    for(i=1, i<=WAVE_COUNT, ++i)
        // animate phase of each wave from its original phase to phase-1 and then reset;
        // this moves the wave forward in the X,Y direction
        f = filters[start+i]
        animate(f, offset=f:offset, time=0, loop=-1, flags=ANIMATION_PARALLEL)
        animate(offset=f:offset-1, time=rand()*20+10)
</xmp>

<p>The equation governing the wave distortion is size &times; sin(2&pi;(d - offset)),
where d is the number of wave periods' distance from the center along the x, y
direction.

<p>The <tt>WAVE_SIDEWAYS</tt> flag will cause the distortion to be transverse
(perpendicular) to the wave instead of in the same direction as the wave. The
<tt>WAVE_BOUNDED</tt> flag limits the distortion to the confines of this image,
instead of lettings its pixels spill out a little further from the distortion
(and likewise, transparent pixels spill inward).

<p>Up to 10 waves can be stacked together in a single pass of the filter, as long as they
have the same <tt>WAVE_BOUNDED</tt> flags.
