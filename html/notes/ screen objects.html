<p>HUD stands for Heads-Up Display, and refers to any atoms that appear on
the screen but don't move when the player moves. These are also called screen
objects. Any movable atom can be added to the HUD by setting its
<tt>screen_loc</tt> var, and adding it to <tt>client.screen</tt> for each user
who is supposed to see it. This can be used to display a character's vital
stats, scores, etc.

<p>If you want to have something like a health meter or name attached to a
moving atom, use overlays or <tt>/image</tt> objects instead. An
<tt>/image</tt> object is similar to a screen object in that it can be shown
to only certain players instead of being shown to everyone.

<p>The size of the screen depends on <tt>client.view</tt> (or
<tt>world.view</tt>), <tt>world.map_format</tt>, and <tt>world.icon_size</tt>.
In a normal topdown map format, <tt>client.view</tt> is the same as the screen
size; in other map formats the screen might be a different size.

<p>The <tt>screen_loc</tt> var can be set to a value like <tt>"1,1"</tt> (the
southwest tile of the screen), <tt>"4,NORTH"</tt> (fourth tile from the west,
along the north side of the screen), <tt>"SOUTHEAST"</tt>, and so on. You can
also include pixel offsets, percentages, and specify two corners to tile an
icon repeatedly from one end to the other. See
<a class=code href=#/atom/movable/var/screen_loc>screen_loc</a> for more
details.

<p><tt>screen_loc</tt> can also be used to stretch the bounds of the HUD. A
value of <tt>"0,0"</tt> will cause the atom to appear to the southwest of the
southwest-most tile on the visible map, outside of the regular map bounds.
Using HUDs in this way, you can provide a nice decorative "frame" for your map.

<p>More complex 

<p>You can use HUDs in other map controls as well, by preceding screen_loc with
the name of the map you will use followed by a colon. For instance,
<tt>screen_loc="map2:1,1"</tt> will show an icon in the southwest corner of the
<tt>map2</tt> control. The actual size of a secondary HUD is based on how far
out the icons in it extend in any direction. If you have one icon at
<tt>"map2:1,1"</tt> and another at <tt>"map2:4,3"</tt>, then that HUD will be
four tiles wide and three high.
