<p>This is used to access the procs and vars of a prototyped object.  The
variable need not actually contain a value with the specified type, but must
at least be a type with the specified variable or a runtime error will
occur, causing the proc to crash.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
var/mob/M = new
M.name = "futz"  // assign 'name' mob var
M.Move(0)        // call 'Move()' mob proc
</xmp>

<p>This is the same as the <tt>:</tt> operator, except that the compiler
checks to see if the var type has this property, and throws a compiler error
if not. It is good practice to use the <tt>.</tt> operator whenever possible,
so more potential problems can be caught during compilation.

<p>If <tt>.</tt> follows a proc call, a list lookup, or a complex expression
where the type can't be known, it will act like <tt>:</tt> instead.
