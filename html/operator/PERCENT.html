<dd>A % B

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The remainder of A / B, where both A and B are integers.
</dl>

<p><tt>A % B</tt> is read "A modulo B", which stands for the remainder of A
divided by B.

<p>This operator only works with integer values, for legacy reasons. A and
B are truncated to integers before the modulo operation. There are uses for
the integer truncation, but if you don't want that and want the fractional
modulo instead, you can now use the <tt>%%</tt> operator.

<p>If A is a vector, its components are treated as integers; B can also be
a vector in this case, and its components are also treated as integers. The
result is a new vector.

<p>If A is a pixloc, it's treated like a 2D vector and the modulo operation
is done with that instead.
