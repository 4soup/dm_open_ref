<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>A |= B
</dl>

<p>Set A equal to A | B.  It is shorthand for A = A | B.

<p>This is commonly used to turn on certain bitfields in a word.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
usr.sight |= BLIND // turn on the blind bit
</xmp>

<p>If A and B are lists, any items in B that are not already in A are added
to A.

<p>If A is an /icon or /matrix datum, the datum will be changed rather than
creating a new one and re-assigning it to A.
