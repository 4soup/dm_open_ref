<p class="sidebar didyouknow">The only false values in DM are the number 0, an
empty text string, or null. All other values are considered true.

<p>The first true value from left to right completes the evaluation (a
practice known as short-circuiting)), meaning that any expressions after the
first true value are skipped. The return value is equal to the last operand
to be evaluated.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>mob/verb/Fly()
    if(swimming || IsStuck())
        src << "You can't fly right now!"
        return
</xmp>

<p>In this example, the <tt>IsStuck()</tt> call is not performed if
<tt>swimming</tt> is true.

<p>Although logical short-circuit operators are used most often in blocks such
as <tt>if</tt> or <tt>while</tt>, they can be used elsewhere.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
// if current_target is null, pick a new one
var/target = current_target || PickTarget()
</xmp>
