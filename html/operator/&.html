<dd>A & B
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The binary "and" of A and B.
</dl>

<p>A and B must be between 0 and 2**24 - 1, giving an effective
width of 24 bits.

<p>If A and B are lists, the result is a list that contains only items that
were in both lists, in the order of list A.

<p>If A is an icon or /icon datum, it is blended with B which can be either
a color or another icon. This is identical to the + operator. Transparent
areas in either icon will be transparent in the result.
