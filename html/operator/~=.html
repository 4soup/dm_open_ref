<p>Equivalence is a looser version of equality:

<ul>
<li>Two lists are equivalent if their contents are the same. (This is a
shallow comparison, so it doesn't check if the Nth items are also
equivalent, only equal.)</li>
<li>Two <a href=#/matrix>/matrix</a> values are equivalent if their components
are the same.</li>
<li>Datums A and B are equivalent if A <dd><a href=#/operator/overload>overloads</a>
the ~= operator with a proc that returns true for B. Without an overload,
they are only equivalent if they're the same object.</li>
</ul>

<p>To check if A and B are equal, use the == operator.

<p>Note: For code compiled in version 516 or later,
<a href=#/list/assoc>associated values</a> in lists are also checked for
equality. This was not the case for older versions.
