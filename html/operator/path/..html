<p>The dot operator may be used as a short-cut when specifying a path in the
DM code tree.  Instead of specifying the full path, you can start a path with
a dot and the compiler will search up in the code tree for the following node.
This is known as a relative path with an "upward" search.

<p>Here are the beginnings of a text MUD that allows you to walk around
between rooms using the arrow keys.  The links between rooms are created in
this example by referencing the object type of the destination room.  Since
there could potentially be a lot of rooms, they are grouped into sub-classes,
and to avoid lengthy type paths such as /area/Village/Square, they are
referenced using a relative path from the point of reference.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
area
   var/area
      north_exit
      south_exit
      east_exit
      west_exit

   Entered(O)
      O << name
      return ..()

   Castle
      Main_Gate
         north_exit = .Castle_Entryway
         south_exit = .Moat_Bridge
      Castle_Entryway
         south_exit = .Main_Gate
      Moat_Bridge
         north_exit = .Main_Gate
         south_exit = .Village/Guard_Post
   Village
      Guard_Post
         north_exit = .Castle/Moat_Bridge
         south_exit = .Square
      Square
         north_exit = .Guard_Post

//handle movement
client/Move(Dest,Dir)
   var/area/room = usr.loc
   if(istype(room)) //in a room
      switch(Dir)
         if(NORTH) Dest = room.north_exit
         if(SOUTH) Dest = room.south_exit
         if(EAST)  Dest = room.east_exit
         if(WEST)  Dest = room.west_exit
   return ..()

//set the starting position for new logins
mob/Login()
   if(!loc) Move(locate(/area/Castle/Main_Gate))
   return ..()
