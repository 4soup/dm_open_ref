<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>A ||= B
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>Value of <tt>(A || B)</tt> after it has been assigned to A. This
expression can stand by itself; its result does not need to be assigned to
anything else.
</dl>

<p>First A is evaluated. If its value is false, B will be evaluated and
assigned to A. If A is true, B will not be evaluated and A will remain
unchanged.

<p>Note that this is slightly different from <tt>if(!A) A = B</tt> if A is
a complex expression such as <tt>list[index++]</tt>, because the expression
is only evaluated once.

<p>This operator cannot be overloaded.
