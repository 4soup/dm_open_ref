<p class="sidebar didyouknow">The only false values in DM are the number 0, an
empty text string, or null. All other values are considered true.

<p>The first false value from left to right completes the evaluation (a
practice known as short-circuiting), meaning that any expressions after the
first false value are skipped. The return value is equal to the last operand
to be evaluated.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>if(jumping && CanDoubleJump())
    DoubleJump()
</xmp>

<p>In this example, the <tt>CanDoubleJump()</tt> call is not performed if
<tt>jumping</tt> is false.

<p>Although logical short-circuit operators are used most often in blocks such
as <tt>if</tt> or <tt>while</tt>, they can be used elsewhere.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
// check if current target is valid, if it exists at all
// but don't call the proc if we don't have to
var/target = current_target && TargetIsValid(current_target)
</xmp>
