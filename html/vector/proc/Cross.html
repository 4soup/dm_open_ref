<dd>A.Cross(vector/B)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The cross product of the two vectors, which is another vector.
</dl>

<p>This proc treats both vectors as 3D.

<p>The cross product of two 3D vectors is a third vector that is orthogonal
to them both. The length is the product of the length of both vectors and the
sine of the angle between them.

<p>The cross product depends on the order of the two vectors. If you switch
their order, you get the negative result.
