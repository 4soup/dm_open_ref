<dd>B: The other vector.

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The dot product of the two vectors.
</dl>

<p>The dot product of two vectors is determined by multiplying each component
in the first vector by its matching component in the second, and adding those
multiples together. For instance in a 2D vector, the dot product of A and B
is:

<xmp>dot = A.x * B.x + A.y + B.y</xmp>

<p>The dot product is equal to the product of the magnitude of the two vectors
and the cosine of the angle between them.

<xmp>dot = A.size * B.size * cos(angle)</xmp>
