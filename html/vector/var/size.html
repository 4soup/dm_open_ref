<p>The magnitude of this vector. Magnitude is the square root of
the summed-up squares of all its components. For instance in 3D:

<p>size = x*x + y*y + z*z

<p><tt>V.size</tt> is the same as <tt>sqrt(V.Dot(V))</tt>.

<p>This value can be set at runtime, so setting <tt>size = 1</tt> will
normalize the vector.

<p>If the size is already 0, as in the case of a degenerate vector like 0,0,
then changing this value will have no effect.
