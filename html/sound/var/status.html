<p>Alter the way the sound is heard by affecting several different on/off
values which combine as bit flags.

<xmp>
SOUND_MUTE      // do not play the sound
SOUND_PAUSED    // pause sound
SOUND_STREAM    // create as a stream
SOUND_UPDATE    // update a playing sound
</xmp>

<p>Use the <tt>|</tt> operator to combine these values. The setting you choose
will take effect when the sound is sent to a player.

<p><tt>SOUND_MUTE | SOUND_UPDATE</tt> will mute a sound, but it will continue
to play. It can be unmuted while still playing by resending it with
<tt>status=SOUND_UPDATE</tt>.

<p><tt>SOUND_PAUSED | SOUND_UPDATE</tt> will pause a sound. It can be
restarted from its current position by resending it with
<tt>status=SOUND_UPDATE</tt>.

<p><tt>SOUND_STREAM</tt> will create this sound as a stream. Streams take less
memory, but can not play multiple times at once, nor can they play in reverse.
This flag is only valid the first time that a sound is played in a particular
mode (normal vs. 3D). Changing the flag later will not change the stream
status of the sound in that mode.

<p><tt>SOUND_UPDATE</tt> updates the settings for the sound currently playing
on the specified channel. If this flag is not set or no channel is specified,
the sound will start again from the beginning.

<p>Some of the flags for this value may be filled in by the
<tt>SoundQuery</tt> proc.
