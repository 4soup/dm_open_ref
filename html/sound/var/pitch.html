<p>Can be used to shift the pitch of a sound up or down. This works similarly
to frequency except that it doesn't impact playback speed.

<p>The value of this var should be a multiple relative to 1, so for instance
to go up a full octave, the value would be 2; to go down an octave, use 0.5.

<p>Note: The filter that handles pitch shifting only goes from 0.5 to 2. The
player will stack up to three filters if it has to, so the range is really
from 0.125 to 8. You will however hear much poorer quality at more extreme
values.

<p>To make a sound play at a different speed but keep its pitch intact, set
<tt>frequency</tt> to the speed multiple you want (e.g., 1.2 for 20% faster)
and set <tt>pitch</tt> to the inverse (e.g., 1/1.2).

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
client
    var/sound/music // music currently playing

    proc/PlayMusic(music)
        music = new(music)
        music.channel = 100
        src << music

    proc/UpTempo(amount = 0.1)  // 10% faster
        if(!music) return
        music.frequency = (music.frequency || 1) + amount
        music.pitch = 1 / music.frequency
        music.status |= SOUND_UPDATE
        src << music
</xmp>
