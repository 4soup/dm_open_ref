<p>Set to different values to give your sound a 3D effect which will be applied
when it is played. Positive values for <tt>x</tt> will sound as if they come
from the right, positive <tt>y</tt> sounds like it is above the player's head,
and positive <tt>z</tt> sounds like it is directly ahead. The effect of 3D sound
depends on the player's computer's sound card, and is greatly enhanced when
wearing headphones.

<p>Depending on the value of <tt>falloff</tt>, the settings for the location of
the sound can also affect its volume. Once the distance passes the value of
<tt>falloff</tt>, the volume will diminish.

<p>If these values are all set to 0, you should set <tt>environment</tt> if you
want to treat it as a 3D sound. Otherwise BYOND will assume this is meant to be
a non-3D sound such as music or the interface.
