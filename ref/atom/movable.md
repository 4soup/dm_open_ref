The /atom/movable object type is the ancestor of all mappable
objects that are capable of motion. The types /obj and /mob are derived
from /atom/movable. You should not create instances of /atom/movable but
should use /obj and /mob for actual objects. This object definition
exists solely to define variables and procedures related to motion.
