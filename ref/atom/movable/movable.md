The /atom/movable object type is the ancestor of all mappable objects    
that are capable of motion. The types /obj and /mob are derived from    
/atom/movable. You should not create instances of /atom/movable but    
should use /obj and /mob for actual objects. This object definition    
exists solely to define variables and procedures related to motion.
