This sets the object\'s gender. This influences text macros like `\he`,    
which may expand to \"it\", \"he\", \"she\", or \"they\". Valid values    
are: \"neuter\" \"male\" \"female\" \"plural\" These are also defined as    
constants, which may help prevent typos, since the compiler will    
complain if it doesn\'t recognize what you type: NEUTER MALE FEMALE    
PLURAL
