<p>This var is a list of graphical filters to use for post-processing effects,
applied in order. You can assign this value a list, an individual filter, or
null to empty it.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
obj/blurry
    filters = filter(type="blur", size=1)
</xmp>

<p>Atoms with the <code>KEEP_TOGETHER</code> flag will apply their filters
after the composite image has been drawn. Filters will also apply to any
maptext the atom has.

<p>See the <a href=#/{notes}/filters>filters</a> section for more information
on individual filters.

<h3 byondver=516>Named Filters</h3>

<p>Filters can be created with a <tt>name</tt> argument. That name can be used
to access the filter in the list (e.g. <tt>filters["drunk_blur"]</tt> instead
of using a numeric index, which is helpful for managing animations and
updating multiple filters on an object.

<p>Adding a new filter with the same name as an existing filter will remove the
old one, since only one of a given filter name can be used on an appearance at
a time.

<p>You can also remove a named filter from the list simply by subtracting the
name instead of the filter itself. That is, <tt>filters -= filters["foo"]</tt>
and <tt>filters -= "foo"</tt> do the same thing.
