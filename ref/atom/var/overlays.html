<div class="sidebar">
<p>Overlays are relatively static and cannot be altered on the fly, only
replaced. They're your best-performing option for very simple things that
won't change often. If you need something that allows dynamic changes you may
prefer to look into <a href=#/image>image objects</a> (which can also be
selectively shown to only certain players) or
<a href=#/atom/var/vis_contents>visual contents</a> which are more versatile.
</div>

<p>This is a list of simple icons which are displayed on top of the object's
main icon.

<p>The individual items in the list may not be directly accessed, since they
are stored in a <a href=#/atom/var/appearance>special internal format</a>.
However, the list operators <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, and the
procedures <code>Add</code>, <code>Remove</code>, and <code>Cut</code> work
normally.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
turf/verb/AddOverlay(I as icon)
   overlays += I
turf/verb/RemoveOverlay(I as icon)
   overlays -= I
</xmp>

<p>The data types that may be used as overlays are icons, icon states (text
strings), objects, and object types.  When an icon state is used, the
corresponding image in the object's icon is displayed.  When another object is
used as an overlay, a static "snapshot" of the object is taken at the time
when the overlay is created.  Future changes to the object will not change the
appearance of the overlay, except that in some cases the overlay may inherit
things from the base object like its icon (if left empty), direction, and
moving state.

<p>Overlays have their own independent drawing layer.  It is normally the
special value FLOAT_LAYER, which makes them float above the base object.  If
the overlay is a snapshot of another object, the drawing layer of that object
is used (and in that case, the overlay can appear beneath the object if its
layer is lower).  The important advantage of using FLOAT_LAYER is that if the
layer of the base object changes, the overlays will move with it into the new
layer.

<p>Any negative number may be used in place of FLOAT_LAYER (which happens to
be -1).  They all cause the same "floating" behavior.  However, the overlays
are ordered amongst themselves according to their own relative layer values
(-2 below -1 and so on).  This may be useful if you have several classes of
overlays that should always appear in a certain order, because you would not
have to worry about the order in which you add them to the list.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
var/const
   ARMOR_LAYER = FLOAT_LAYER-1
   CLOTHES_LAYER = FLOAT_LAYER-2
obj/overlay
   armor
      icon = 'armor.dmi'
      layer = ARMOR_LAYER
   clothes
      icon = 'clothes.dmi'
      layer = CLOTHES_LAYER
mob/verb
   wear_clothes()
      overlays += /obj/overlay/clothes
   wear_armor()
      overlays += /obj/overlay/armor
   remove_clothes()
      overlays -= /obj/overlay/clothes
   remove_armor()
      overlays -= /obj/overlay/armor
</xmp>

<p>That example used object types, but you can use instances of objects as
well.  Rather than using different "float" layers, you can also just make your
own list of overlays with the order you want and assign that to the actual
overlays list.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/var
   boots
   clothes
	armor
mob/proc
   ShowOverlays()
      var/L[0]
      if(boots)   L += boots
      if(clothes) L += clothes
      if(armor)   L += armor
      overlays = L
</xmp>
