This causes the object to be visible in the dark to mobs that can see    
infrared light. Nothing but the object itself is lit up by the infrared    
emission. The scale is identical to luminosity: 1 makes it visible only    
from the same location; 2 makes it visible from a neighboring position;    
and so on.
