## infra_luminosity var (atom)

**Default value:**
+   0


This causes the object to be visible in the dark to mobs that
can see infrared light. Nothing but the object itself is lit up by the
infrared emission. The scale is identical to luminosity: 1 makes it
visible only from the same location; 2 makes it visible from a
neighboring position; and so on.
