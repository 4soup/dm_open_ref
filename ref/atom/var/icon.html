<p>This is the icon file that will be used to represent the object on
graphical clients.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
turf/wall
   icon = 'wall.dmi'
</xmp>

<p>You can also assign this to an external file at run-time with an expression
such as file("wall.dmi"), but you would only want to do that when the other
method is not possible, because it requires addition of the file to the
resource cache, which can take a little time.

<p>When this variable is set to any dynamically created icon object, that
object gets dumped into the world's resource cache (the <tt>.rsc</tt> file),
and a reference to that cached file is assigned to atom.icon.  In other words,
don't expect comparisons such as <code>usr.icon ==
MyDynamicallyCreatedIcon</code> to work unless you have used fcopy_rsc() to
get a cache reference to your dynamically created icon first.  This is almost
never an issue, so don't worry about it if none of that made any sense to you!
