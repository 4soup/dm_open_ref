<dl><dt><b>Default value:</b>
<dd>The z coordinate of the object on the map.
</dl>

<p>The z coordinate is how objects move between maps.  When you include
several maps in a project, they are placed on different z levels so that the
full map is a single 3-dimensional space.  It is also possible for a single
map file to contain multiple z levels.

<p>Do not confuse this with drawing layer.  The z coordinate moves an object
between different maps.  The layer variable determines the order in which an
object is drawn graphically relative to other objects at the same position on
the map.

<p>You may assign the coordinates of movable objects (mobs and objs), but this
is not advisable.  It is better to compute the new location (with
<code>locate()</code>) and move them to that.  Then you can use the normal
<code>Move()</code> procedure, which enables all the normal movement behavior.

<p>For areas that are on the map, this is the coordinate of the turf with the
lowest z, y, and x coordinate (in that order) that is contained by the area.
