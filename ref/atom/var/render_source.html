<p>If any icon uses <tt>render_source</tt>, the renderer will look for another
icon with a matching <tt>render_target</tt> value on the visible map, and draw
that in place of the <tt>icon</tt>/<tt>icon_state</tt>/<tt>dir</tt> that it
normally would. The same render target might be used as a source multiple
times, and for a complex image this can save some rendering time. This is also
usable for special effects such as <a href=#/{notes}/filters>filters</a> that
might require copies of an image.

<p>Note: The corresponding <tt>render_target</tt> <i>must</i> be visible to the
player for a render source to be used.

<p>The replacement icon from the <tt>render_source</tt> will be anchored to the
bottom left of the icon it replaces.

<p>Other vars that would normally affect the appearance of this icon, such as
<tt>color</tt>, <tt>transform</tt>, <tt>filters</tt>, <tt>appearance_flags</tt>,
etc. are all applied. Additionally, if this object has overlays, underlays, or
visual contents, those will still be drawn as well.

<p>Note: Any mouse hits on this object belong to the object itself, not to the
object used in the <tt>render_source</tt> or its children. If you want mouse
clicks and other behavior to go to the source, use the <tt>PASS_MOUSE</tt>
<a href=#/atom/var/appearance_flags>appearance flag</a>.
