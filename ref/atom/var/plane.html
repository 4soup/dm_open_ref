<p>The value of plane overrides layer, and is mainly used for non-topdown map
formats like isometric.  Positive values are drawn on top, and negative values
are drawn below.  This mostly deprecates <tt>EFFECTS_LAYER</tt> and
<tt>BACKGROUND_LAYER</tt>, but they can still be useful when using
<tt>PLANE_MASTER</tt> for effects
(see <a class=code href=#/atom/var/appearance_flags>appearance_flags</a>).

<p>The special value <tt>FLOAT_PLANE</tt> can be used for images and overlays,
to take on the plane of the parent atom. Whenever an icon or icon_state is
used directly as an overlay, this is its plane. If there is no parent atom,
the plane is 0.

<p byondver=513>You can also use <tt>FLOAT_PLANE</tt> as a relative value, so
<tt>FLOAT_PLANE+1</tt> adds 1 to the parent atom's plane. This may be useful
for some applications where an object is included in visual contents. The
added value should still be kept in the range of -10000 to 10000, or
preferably much smaller.
