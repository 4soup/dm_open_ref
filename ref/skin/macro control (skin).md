## macro control (skin)    
A [keyboard/gamepad/mouse macro](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/macros.md), usually designed    
to run a [command](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/commands.md). The control is a means of    
interacting with the macro as an object, allowing some of its properties    
to be changed at runtime.    
**Macro-specific parameters:**

:   [map-to](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/map-to.md)
