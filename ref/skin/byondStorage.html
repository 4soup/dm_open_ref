<h2>byondStorage (browser control)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/{skin}/control/browser>browser control (skin)</a>
<dd><a href=#/proc/winset>winset proc</a>
</dl>

<p>A replacement for <tt>localStorage</tt> that can be used to hold
information that can be used in later sessions of the same game. (This must be
enabled via <tt>browser-options</tt> with the
<a href=#/proc/winset><tt>winset()</tt> proc</a>.)

<p>There are three actual storage objects you can use:

<table class=codefirst>
<tr><td>hubStorage</td><td>Stores info that can be shared for all games falling under this same <a href=#/world/var/hub>hub entry</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>serverStorage</td><td>Stores info that can be shared for all games using this same server address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>domainStorage</td><td>Same as serverStorage, but ignores the connection port.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Interacting with these storage objects is done in JavaScript, the same way
you would use <tt>localStorage</tt> or <tt>sessionStorage</tt>.

<p>Note: Technically <tt>localStorage</tt> does work, but because of the way
BYOND handles browser controls it acts more like <tt>sessionStorage</tt> in
practice.
