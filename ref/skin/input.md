[]{#/{skin}/control/input}    
## input control (skin)    
A text box into which the user can type. By default this is used for    
sending [client commands](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/commands/commands.md), but it can be used for    
other purposes as well.    
**Input-specific parameters:**    
:   [command](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/command/command.md)    
:   [is-password](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/is-password/is-password.md)    
:   [multi-line](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/multi-line/multi-line.md)    
:   [no-command](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/no-command/no-command.md)    
:   [on-blur](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/on-blur/on-blur.md)    
:   [on-focus](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/on-focus/on-focus.md)    
:   [text](/ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/text/text.md)    
Note that when in \"standard\" mode of accepting user commands, built-in    
verbs like `.click`, or local commands like `.winset`, are not accepted    
when typed in. This kind of command can still be entered manually    
through the Client menu of the Options & Messages window.
