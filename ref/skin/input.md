[]{#/{skin}/control/input}    
## input control (skin)    
A text box into which the user can type. By default this is used for    
sending [client commands](ref/%7Bskin%7D/commands), but it can be used for    
other purposes as well.    
**Input-specific parameters:**    
:   [command](ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/command)    
:   [is-password](ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/is-password)    
:   [multi-line](ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/multi-line)    
:   [no-command](ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/no-command)    
:   [on-blur](ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/on-blur)    
:   [on-focus](ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/on-focus)    
:   [text](ref/%7Bskin%7D/param/text)    
Note that when in \"standard\" mode of accepting user commands, built-in    
verbs like `.click`, or local commands like `.winset`, are not accepted    
when typed in. This kind of command can still be entered manually    
through the Client menu of the Options & Messages window.
