<p>Areas are derived from <tt>/area</tt>, which derives from <tt>/atom</tt>.
Regions on the map may be assigned to an area by painting it onto the map.
Areas off the map serve as rooms that objects may enter and exit.

<p>For each area type defined, one area object is created at runtime.  So for
areas on the map, all squares with the same area type belong to the same
instance of the area.

<p>Additional instances of rooms may be created from the same type by
explicitly creating them with null as the initial location.  That is, the
first argument to <tt>new()</tt> should either be <tt>null</tt> or left
unspecified.

<p>The following example defines the area prototype
<tt>/area/outside</tt>.  It also defines an action to be taken when somebody
enters an area, namely to display its description.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
area
  Entered(O)
    if(desc) O << desc
    return ..()

  outside
    desc = "Ah!  A breath of fresh air!"
</xmp>
