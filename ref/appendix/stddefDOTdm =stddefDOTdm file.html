<h2>stddef.dm file</h2>

<p>This is a special file that's included in all projects when you compile.
It contains various constants, definitions of some built-in datums, and so on.

<p>You can see the contents of this file by creating a new file in Dream
Maker called <tt>stddef.dm</tt>. It will automatically be filled with the
standard definitions.

<p>The contents of <tt>stddef.dm</tt> may change with new BYOND versions.
However an eye is always kept on backwards-compatibility.
