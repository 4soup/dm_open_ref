## invisibility setting (verb)

<!-- -->
**Args:**
+   Setting: 0 to 100
<!-- -->
**Default value:**
+   same as invisibility of the source object.


An invisible verb is only accessible to players who can see
invisible objects. This is different from a hidden verb which does not
clutter up the verb list but which is still accessible when typed in
full.
