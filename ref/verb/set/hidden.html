<p>A hidden verb is not visible to players (in menus or in expansion lists)
but if typed in full can still be accessed.

<p>An alternate way to hide a verb from the command-line and verb panels is to
make "." the first character in the name.  The verb will not show up in
command-expansion (ie when hitting spacebar) until the "." has been typed.
This could be useful for hiding verbs that would otherwise clutter up the verb
list, while still making them relatively easy to use.  If you think this is a
random quirky feature, you are right.  To put "." in front of the name, use the
<a href=#/verb/set/name>name setting</a>.
