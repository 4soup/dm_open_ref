**Returns:**    
:   The cross product of the two vectors, which is another vector.    
This proc treats both vectors as 3D.    
The cross product of two 3D vectors is a third vector that is orthogonal    
to them both. The length is the product of the length of both vectors    
and the sine of the angle between them.    
The cross product depends on the order of the two vectors. If you switch    
their order, you get the negative result.
