<p>Special characters such as &lt; and &gt; are not displayed literally in
html and may produce garbled output.  To display these characters literally,
they must be "escaped".  For example, &lt; is produced by the code
<code>&amp;lt;</code> and &gt; is produced by the code <code>&amp;gt;</code>.

<p>The <code>html_decode()</code> instruction takes a text string containing
such escaped symbols and turns them into their literal counterparts.  The
more useful function is <code>html_encode()</code> which does the reverse.
