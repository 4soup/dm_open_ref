<p>This function is used to run an external program.  The syntax of Command
depends on the server machine's operating system.  Be sure to redirect input
and output to files if there is any.  Also realize that the command will
fail if the program you try to run is not in the path where the shell
expects to find executable files (unless you specify a full path).

<p>Since shell() allows arbitrary access to the system, each call requires
authorization from the person hosting the world, unless running in trusted
mode.  Authorization is only sought when running in Dream Seeker, since Dream
Daemon is intended to be non-interactive.  Calling shell() with no arguments
is a way of checking if it is allowed by the current safety settings.  It will
return true if running in Dream Seeker (regardless of safety mode) or if
running in Dream Daemon in trusted mode.

<p>The calling proc will sleep until the command is finished executing.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/dir(Path as text)
  shell("dir [Path] > dir.out")
  usr << file2text("dir.out")
</xmp>

<p>This example displays the output of the "dir" command to the user.
