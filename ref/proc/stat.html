<p>This is used in a Stat() proc to send a stat line to usr, the person
looking at an object.  A stat line has an optional name part which must be
unique for each stat line (or successive calls will replace previous ones).

<p>The stat line gets appended to the current stat panel.  The current panel
may be changed by using statpanel().

<p>If no name is specified and the value is a list, this is the same as
calling stat on each item in the list.  This can be used (in conjunction
with statpanel) to create an inventory panel or something similar.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/Stat()
   stat("description",src.desc)
   if(src == usr) stat(src.contents)
</xmp>

<p>This example displays the mob's description and inventory all in one panel.
The code ensures that only the mob may see his own inventory, but you don't
have to worry about that unless you change client.statobj to something other
than one's own mob.
