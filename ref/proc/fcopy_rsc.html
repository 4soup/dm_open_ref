<dd>File: file to copy into the resource cache

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>reference to the file as a cache entry
</dl>

<p>The file to copy may either be a file name (text string) or the return
value of file() operating on the same.  If a cache entry is passed as the
argument, it will simply be returned with no action necessary.

<p>Once a file has been copied into the resource cache (i.e. the world's .rsc
file), it may be used as an icon or a sound or whatever is appropriate.  Most
internal operations involving resource files automatically perform this
operation when you try to use an external file in place of a cache entry.  For
example, when assigning a file() object to atom.icon, fcopy_rsc() is
implicitly invoked.

<p>The main reason you would ever want to call this explicitly is if you are
storing references to resource files in your own data structures and you want
to ensure that all values are converted to cache entries so they may be
directly compared to one another.
