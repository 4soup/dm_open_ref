<h2>get_dist proc</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/proc/bounds_dist>bounds_dist proc</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>get_dist(Loc1, Loc2)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The distance between <tt>Loc1</tt> and <tt>Loc2</tt>, in tiles.  This is
the number of full-tile movements (disregarding any obstacles and allowing
diagonal moves <i>including across Z levels</i>) required to go from one to
the other.  You can think of it as the max of their x, y, and z distances.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Loc1: An object on the map.
<dd>Loc2: An object on the map.
</dl>

<p>For a distance in pixels, use <tt>bounds_dist()</tt>.

<p><tt>get_dist()</tt> will return -1 when <tt>Loc1</tt> and <tt>Loc2</tt> are
the same object. If one or both of them is not on the map, an infinite value
is returned.

<p>Note: Prior to BYOND 515, <tt>get_dist()</tt> never returned a value
greater than 127, which it counted as "infinite".
