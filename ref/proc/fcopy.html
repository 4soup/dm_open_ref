<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>fcopy(Src,Dst)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Src: file to copy
<dd>Dst: new copy to make
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>1 on success; 0 otherwise.

<p>Src may be either a cache file, a savefile, or the name of an external
file.  Cache files are specified in single quotes and external files are in
double quotes.  If the path to the destination file does not already exist,
it will be created.

<p>If the source and target are paths ending in "/", the contents of the
source directory (including sub-directories) will be copied to the target
path.

<p>This instruction could be useful when players upload files (like code)
that you might want to dump to an external file.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/verb/change_world(F as file)
  fcopy(F,"world.dm")
  shell("DreamMaker world")
  world.Reboot()
</xmp>

<p>This (somewhat dangerous) example allows players to upload code, recompile,
and reboot the world.  It assumes that DreamMaker is in the path where the
shell looks for executable files and also that the name of the running world
is world.dmb.
