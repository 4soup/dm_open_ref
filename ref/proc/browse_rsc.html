<h2>browse_rsc proc</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/proc/browse>browse proc</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>usr &lt;&lt; browse_rsc(File,FileName)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>File: a resource file (such as an image)
<dd>FileName: name of file (if different from source file)
</dl>

<p>This sends the specified resource file to usr (or anybody else) and
stores it in their <code>cache</code> directory with the specified name.  In
subsequent <code>browse()</code> output, you can then refer to that file.

<p>If your world is always running on the internet, you can save yourself
the trouble and simply link to the image files through a web server.
However, if it may be played offline, you can compile in the resource files
and manually send them to players with <code>browse_rsc()</code>.

<p>Note that no data is transmitted if it already exists in the user's
cache, so there is little overhead in calling this every time you are about
to use <code>browse()</code>.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
area
   var
      room_graphic = 'cozy_room.jpg'
   Enter(O)
      . = ..() //do default checks
      if(.)    //if we got clearance to enter
         O << browse_rsc(room_graphic,"room.jpg")
         O << browse("<p><img src=room.jpg></p>[desc]")
</xmp>
