<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>spantext(Haystack,Needles,Start=1)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The number of consecutive characters, from the start position, that match the characters in Needles.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Haystack: The text string to search.
<dd>Needles: A text string with all the characters that match.
<dd>Start: The text byte position in Haystack in which to begin the search.
</dl>

<p>This proc is case-sensitive.  A common use for this proc is in parsing.
spantext("apples, oranges",", ",7) will tell you that, starting at position 7,
you need to skip 2 characters to get past any commas or spaces.

<p>If the start position is negative, the position is counted backwards from
the end of the string.

<p>Note: In strings containing non-ASCII characters, byte position and
character position are not the same thing. Use <tt>spantext_char()</tt> to
work with character counts instead of bytes, at a performance cost. See the
<a href=#/{notes}/Unicode>Unicode</a> section for more information.
