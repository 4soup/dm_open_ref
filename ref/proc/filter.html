<p>Creates a graphical filter that can be assigned or added to a list of
filters on an atom or image.

<p>This proc uses named arguments, and the "type" value must always be
included. To see which types of filters are available and what parameters
they accept, see <a href=#/{notes}/filters>Filter effects</a>.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
atom/proc/Highlight(apply)
    if(apply)
        filters = filter(type="outline", size=1, color=rgb(255,0,0))
    else
        filters = null
</xmp>

<p>A filter created with this proc is an <i>abstract</i> filter; it is not
associated with any atom. When you add it to atom's filters, the atom gets a
copy of this filter, so changing the abstract filter's values afterward will
not change the atom's filters. For the same reason, an abstract filter can't
be animated.

<p>A filter that is part of an atom's filters list, like obj.filters[1], is an
<i>attached</i> filter. Changing the values for an attached filter will change
how that atom is displayed, and attached filters can be animated.

<h3 byondver=516>Named Filters</h3>

<p>Filters can also be given a <tt>name</tt> argument, and can be referred
to in an atom's <tt>filters</tt> list via that name (e.g. as
<tt>filters["shadow"]</tt>) instead of a numeric index.
