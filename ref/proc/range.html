<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>range(Dist,Center=usr)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>A list of objects within Dist tiles of Center.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>Dist:   A number.
<dd>Center: An object on the map.
</dl>

<p>This instruction is identical to view() except visibility is ignored.
All objects are included in the list whether they are visible or not.

<p>A Dist of 0 includes Center, the contents of Center (normally
usr.contents), its location (normally the turf a mob is standing on), and any
other contents of that location.  A value of 1 extends the region to the
neighboring squares on the map and so on.  You can also use a rectangular box
size using a text string such as "13x11".  Both arguments are optional and may
be passed in any order.
