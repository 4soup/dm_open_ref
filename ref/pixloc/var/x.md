The x value of this pixloc in world pixel coordinates, which start at 1.    
A value of x=1 means this is lined up to the western edge of the map. On    
a 100x100 tile map with a 32x32 icon size, x=3200 would be a pixel on    
the eastern edge of the map.    
Setting x will alter the loc and step_x values automatically.    
Out-of-bounds values are allowed.
