The y value of this pixloc in world pixel coordinates, which start at 1.    
A value of y=1 means this is lined up to the southern edge of the map.    
On a 100x100 tile map with a 32x32 icon size, y=3200 would be a pixel on    
the northern edge of the map.    
Setting y will alter the loc and step_y values automatically.    
Out-of-bounds values are allowed.
