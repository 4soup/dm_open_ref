<p>A generator is an object that can produce a random number, vector (list of 3 numbers), color (as a text string), or color matrix (list of 20 numbers) in a specified range according to rules you set down. It is used primarily for particle effects, since it can run on the client.

<p>There are several types of generators:

<ul>
<li><b>Numbers:</b> Generate a random real number.</li>
<li><b>Vectors:</b> Generate a random vector.</li>
<li><b>Shapes:</b> Generate a random vector within a specific shaped region.</li>
<li><b>Colors:</b> Generate a random color or color matrix.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generators can also be chained together with math operators and some procs. The second value can be a regular value instead of a generator, so for instance you can multiply a vector by 2, or by a matrix to transform it.

<tr><th>Operators</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td>+ - * /</td><td>Arithmetic operators. You can multiply a 3D vector by a color matrix (where red,green,blue in the matrix correspond to x,y,z) to do a 3D transform, or by a 2D matrix for a 2D transform.</td></tr>
<tr><td>- (unary)</td><td>Negate the value, same as multiplying by -1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>turn(), generator.Turn()</td><td>Rotate a vector clockwise in the XY plane.</td></tr>
