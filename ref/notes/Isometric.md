:::    
Isometric projection is a form of pseudo-3D in which the 2D icons used    
by BYOND can be arranged in a way to give the appearance of three    
dimensions. If you look at a map top-down, each tile on the map is a    
square. The map is rotated 45° clockwise and then tilted at an angle    
(30°) so that each square now looks like a foreshortened diamond from    
the viewer\'s perspective. What was once north now points to the    
northeast end of the viewer\'s screen; what was once east now points    
southeast to the viewer. Tiles that are more to the south or east are    
\"nearer\" to the viewer, and tiles that are north or west are    
\"farther\". The actual direction the map faces can be changed by using    
`client.dir`.    
It is important to remember that this is an illusion of 3D, not real 3D.    
To use isometric mapping, set `world.map_format` to `ISOMETRIC_MAP`. You    
should set `world.icon_size` so the tile width is a multiple of 4    
pixels. The width of the tile is highly important. The height of your    
tiles should be at least half that value. BYOND uses a 2:1 isometric    
format, meaning that the diamond base of each tile is half as high as    
its width. For example if you have a 64x64 tile size, every diamond in    
the map will be 64 pixels wide by 32 high, and you have an extra 32    
pixels at the top of your icon for vertical projections like buildings.    
If you set the tile size to 64x80, the base is still a 64x32 diamond and    
you have 48 pixels left over for vertical structures.    
In this mode `pixel_x` and `pixel_y` will offset icons along the    
\"ground\". To adjust horizontal and vertical positions, use the    
`pixel_w` and `pixel_z` vars.    
### Layers    
The `layer` var behaves differently in isometric mode. Because some    
tiles are nearer to the viewer than others, the tiles that are farther    
back need to be drawn first so they are behind any tiles that should go    
in front of them. So in isometric mode, the back row of tiles (a    
diagonal line of them) is drawn first, followed by the next row forward,    
and so on. The `layer` var only matters when icons overlap each other in    
the \"physical\" space, like an obj sitting on a turf.    
When pixel or step offsets, or gliding, place an object on multiple    
turfs, it is drawn on top of the nearer turf (assuming its layer is    
higher).    
Using icons wider than the regular tile size can have an impact on    
layering as well. See [Big icons](/ref/%7Bnotes%7D/big-icons.md) for more    
information.    
Because of the order in which icons are drawn, you may want to limit the    
ability of an atom to cut diagonally around corners. While moving    
northeast behind a dense wall, for instance, a mob might temporarily    
appear in front of the wall because its pixel offsets (from gliding)    
temporarily put it on the same tile as the wall. If you do not want to    
limit corner-cutting, a simple workaround for this case is to give the    
wall a higher layer than the mob.    
Screen objects (in `client.screen`) are always drawn on top of all    
isometric tiles, as is the case in other map modes as well.    
Since it may be desirable in some games to use a topdown map for some    
situations (like a special battle map), you can add `TOPDOWN_LAYER` to    
any atom\'s layer---e.g., `TOPDOWN_LAYER+TURF_LAYER`---to make it appear    
in topdown mode. Topdown and isometric tiles really aren\'t meant to be    
mixed, but if they do mix you\'ll see topdown tiles always display above    
isometric tiles, just like screen objects do. The best way to use this    
is to apply `TOPDOWN_LAYER` to every tile in a certain part of the map    
that the players can\'t walk to.    
If you want to use an overlay that should not be covered by other    
\"nearer\" icons on the map, such as a name or health meter, you can add    
`EFFECTS_LAYER` to the overlay\'s layer. Icons with `EFFECTS_LAYER` will    
draw above regular icons. Then objects with `TOPDOWN_LAYER` will draw on    
top of everything else. However, be aware that `EFFECTS_LAYER` has    
largely been superseded by the `plane` var.    
### Screen size    
In this mode, `world.view` or `client.view` is used to define the    
minimum number of map tiles you will see, *not* the screen/HUD size    
which is calculated from client.view. Extra map tiles are shown to fill    
out the screen size. HUD objects use screen coordinates, so 1,1 is still    
the lower left.    
The actual HUD size is always a full number of tiles, whose size is    
defined by `world.icon_size`. If you have a tile size of `64x64`, and    
`world.view=6` (a 13x13 map), a full 13x13 diamond of map tiles will be    
shown. The width of this diamond is 13 tiles. The height is only half    
that, plus whatever vertical space is needed to show the icons in that    
area. Then everything is rounded up to a full tile size, so the result    
is a 13x7-tile screen. This is the formula you need if you want to    
calculate the screen size: pixel_width = round(icon_width \*    
(view_width + view_height) / 2) pixel_height = round(icon_width \*    
(view_width + view_height - 2) / 4) + icon_height screen_width =    
round((pixel_width + icon_width - 1) / icon_width) screen_height =    
round((pixel_height + icon_height - 1) / icon_height)    
If you use `TOPDOWN_LAYER`, any topdown sections of the map will be    
limited to this same view.
