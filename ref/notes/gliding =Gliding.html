<p>Gliding is a "glitz" effect applied by BYOND to cover up the visual sins
of tile-based movement, by making objects and the map appear to move smoothly
from one tile to another instead of immediately jumping. It is also available to
smooth over small jumps in pixel movement that might occur, for instance if the
client FPS is set higher than the server's.

<p>To control the gliding speed of an atom, set <code>glide_size</code> to the
value of your choice. If this is not set, the client will attempt to adjust
the speed manually.  <code>glide_size</code> is measured in server ticks, so
if <code>client.fps</code> is set to a value greater than <code>world.fps</code>,
it will be scaled appropriately.

<p>Whether an object glides or jumps is based on how far it moves relative to
its <tt>step_size</tt> value, which by default is a full tile width. If the
movement goes too far past <tt>step_size</tt> in the X or Y directions, it's
no longer a glide.

<p>The <tt>animate_movement</tt> var can be used to control the way in which
an object glides, or suppress gliding altogether.

<p>By using the <tt>LONG_GLIDE</tt> flag in <tt>appearance_flags</tt>, a
diagonal glide will take just as long as a cardinal-direction glide by moving
a fullt <tt>glide_size</tt> pixels in the dominant X or Y direction.
Otherwise, gliding tries to move by that many pixels in strict Euclidean
distance (a straight line) and diagonal glides take longer.

<p class=note>In <a class=code href=#/world/var/movement_mode>LEGACY_MOVEMENT_MODE</a>,
gliding is turned off if you set any of the bound or step vars for an atom to
a non-default value. The only gliding that occurs in this case is when
client.fps is higher than world.fps. All other movement modes base gliding on
an atom's <tt>glide_size</tt> value.
