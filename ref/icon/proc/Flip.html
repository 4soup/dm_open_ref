<dd>dir: direction in which to flip over the icon
</dl>

<p>This flips the icon over in the specified direction.  For example,
Flip(NORTH) would be like turning the icon upside down by grabbing the bottom
edge and flipping it up over the top edge.  You would get the same result by
doing Flip(SOUTH).  In general, this is not the same as turning the icon by
180 degrees, because it produces a mirror image.

<p>If an icon is square, it may be flipped diagonally.
