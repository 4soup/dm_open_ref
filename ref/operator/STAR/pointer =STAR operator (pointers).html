<p class="sidebar didyouknow">This operator is also called the dereference
operator, since it takes a pointer reference and gives you the value within.)

<p>When using the <tt>&amp;</tt> operator to get a reference pointer, you can
access the value it points to with this version of the <tt>*</tt> operator.
This can also be used on the left-hand side of assignment operations, for
instance <tt>*A = B</tt> or <tt>*X += Y</tt>, to store the result in the place
the pointer indicates.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
atom/proc/PixelPos(px, py)  // get an exact step position
    *px = (x-1) * 32    // this code assumes a 32x32 icon size
    *py = (y-1) * 32

atom/movable/PixelPos(px, py)  // get an exact step position
    ..()
    *px += step_x   // this code assumes a 32x32 icon size
    *py += step_y

mob/verb/WhereAmI()
    var/X, Y
    PixelPos(&X, &Y)
    usr << "You are at [X],[Y] on level [z]"
</xmp>

<p>Note: If you try to read to or write from a pointer reference that is
no longer valid, such as to a var inside a proc that has ended, the read or
write will fail silently; reading will return a null value. (An exception is
pointers to list items. If the index is out of bounds, you will get the
expected error.)
