## \~= operator {#operator byondver="512"}    
**See also:**    
:   [\~! operator](/operator/~!)    
:   [== operator](/operator/==)    
:   [!= operator](/operator/!=)    
:   [operators](/operator)    
<!-- -->    
**Format:**    
:   A \~= B    
<!-- -->    
**Returns:**    
:   1 if A and B are equivalent; 0 otherwise    
Equivalence is a looser version of equality:    
-   Two lists are equivalent if their contents are the same. (This is a    
    shallow comparison, so it doesn\'t check if the Nth items are also    
    equivalent, only equal.)    
-   Two [/matrix](/matrix) values are equivalent if their components    
    are the same.    
-   Datums A and B are equivalent if A    
    [overloads](/operator/overload) the \~= operator with a proc that    
    returns true for B. Without an overload, they are only equivalent if    
    they\'re the same object.    
To check if A and B are equal, use the == operator.    
Note: For code compiled in version 516 or later, [associated    
values](/list/assoc) in lists are also checked for equality. This was    
not the case for older versions.
