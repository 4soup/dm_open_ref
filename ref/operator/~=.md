## \~= operator 
###### BYOND Version 512

<!-- -->
**Format:**
+   A \~= B
<!-- -->
**Returns:**
+   1 if A and B are equivalent; 0 otherwise


Equivalence is a looser version of equality:
-   Two lists are equivalent if their contents are the same. (This is a
    shallow comparison, so it doesn\'t check if the Nth items are also
    equivalent, only equal.)
-   Two [/matrix](/ref/matrix.md)  values are equivalent if their components
    are the same.
-   Datums A and B are equivalent if A
    [overloads](/ref/operator/overload.md)  the \~= operator with a proc that
    returns true for B. Without an overload, they are only equivalent if
    they\'re the same object.


To check if A and B are equal, use the == operator.


Note: For code compiled in version 516 or later, [associated
values](/ref/list/assoc.md) in lists are also checked for equality. This was
not the case for older versions.
