<p>Set A equal to <tt>A %% B</tt>.  It is shorthand for <tt>A = A %% B</tt>.

<p><tt>A %% B</tt> is read "A modulo B", which stands for the remainder of A divided
by B. This version of the operator works with fractional values for A and B.

<p>If A is a vector, it will be modified by this operation.
