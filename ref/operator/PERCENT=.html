<p>Set A equal to <tt>A % B</tt>.  It is shorthand for <tt>A = A % B</tt>.

<p><tt>A % B</tt> is read "A modulo B", which stands for the remainder of A divided
by B. A and B are truncated to integers before the modulo; use <tt>%%=</tt> instead
to work with fractional values.

<p>If A is a vector, it will be modified by this operation.
