## \^ operator    
**See also:**    
:   [\^= operator](/operator/%5E=)    
:   [operators](/operator)    
<!-- -->    
**Format:**    
:   A \^ B    
<!-- -->    
**Returns:**    
:   The binary \"xor\" of A and B.    
A and B must be between 0 and 2\*\*24 - 1, giving an effective width of    
24 bits.    
If A and B are lists, the result is a list containing items that are in    
either list but not both. list(1,2) \^ list(2,3) is equivalent to    
list(1,3). The items found only in A come first in the result, followed    
by any items found only in B.
