**Format:**

**Returns:**    
:   Value of `(A && B)` after it has been assigned to A. This expression    
    can stand by itself; its result does not need to be assigned to    
    anything else.    
First A is evaluated. If its value is true, B will be evaluated and    
assigned to A. If A is false, B will not be evaluated and A will remain    
unchanged.    
Note that this is slightly different from `if(A) A = B` if A is a    
complex expression such as `list[index++]`, because the expression is    
only evaluated once.    
This operator cannot be overloaded.
