<p>This is the runtime search operator.  It is used to access a property (var
or proc) of a var that is not explicitly prototyped.  If the variable doesn't
have the specified variable or proc, a runtime error occurs.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
var/M
M = usr
M:name = "futz"  // access a mob property from a non-mob var
</xmp>

<p>The <tt>.</tt> operator behaves the same way, but it checks at compile time
whether the property is available.  If the var is assigned a value that isn't
the correct type and doesn't have this property, a runtime error will still
occur.

<p class=tip>Note: You should prefer the <tt>.</tt> operator in most
situations, because it's better to catch a problem in the compiler instead of
at runtime.
