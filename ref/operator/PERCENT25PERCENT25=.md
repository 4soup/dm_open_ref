**Format:**    
:   A %%= B    
Set A equal to `A %% B`. It is shorthand for `A = A %% B`.    
`A %% B` is read \"A modulo B\", which stands for the remainder of A    
divided by B. This version of the operator works with fractional values    
for A and B.    
If A is a vector, it will be modified by this operation.
