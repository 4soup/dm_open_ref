## &= operator
**See also:**
*   [& operator](/ref/operator/&.md) 
*   [operators](/ref/operator.md) 
*   [\|= operator](/ref/operator/%7C=.md) <!-- -->
**Format:**
*   A &= B


Set A equal to A & B. It is shorthand for A = A & B.


This is commonly used to turn off certain bitfields in a word.
### Example:

```
 usr.sight &= \~BLIND // turn off the blind bit 
```



If A and B are lists, items in A that are not in B are removed.


If A is an /icon or /matrix datum, the datum will be changed
rather than creating a new one and re-assigning it to A.
