## . path operator
**See also:**
:   [/ path operator](#/operator/path//)
:   [: path operator](#/operator/path/:)
The dot operator may be used as a short-cut when specifying a path in
the DM code tree. Instead of specifying the full path, you can start a
path with a dot and the compiler will search up in the code tree for the
following node. This is known as a relative path with an \"upward\"
search.
Here are the beginnings of a text MUD that allows you to walk around
between rooms using the arrow keys. The links between rooms are created
in this example by referencing the object type of the destination room.
Since there could potentially be a lot of rooms, they are grouped into
sub-classes, and to avoid lengthy type paths such as
/area/Village/Square, they are referenced using a relative path from the
point of reference.
### Example:
area var/area north_exit south_exit east_exit west_exit Entered(O) O
\<\< name return ..() Castle Main_Gate north_exit = .Castle_Entryway
south_exit = .Moat_Bridge Castle_Entryway south_exit = .Main_Gate
Moat_Bridge north_exit = .Main_Gate south_exit = .Village/Guard_Post
Village Guard_Post north_exit = .Castle/Moat_Bridge south_exit = .Square
Square north_exit = .Guard_Post //handle movement client/Move(Dest,Dir)
var/area/room = usr.loc if(istype(room)) //in a room switch(Dir)
if(NORTH) Dest = room.north_exit if(SOUTH) Dest = room.south_exit
if(EAST) Dest = room.east_exit if(WEST) Dest = room.west_exit return
..() //set the starting position for new logins mob/Login() if(!loc)
Move(locate(/area/Castle/Main_Gate)) return ..()
