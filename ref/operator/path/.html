<p>This is used to delimit paths in the DM code tree.  A path beginning with
'/' is an absolute path (which is independent of where in the code it is
used).  Otherwise, a path is relative, meaning it starts from the current
position in the code.

<p>The following example uses a path in the code tree to define the type of
object to create when leaving a corpse behind.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
obj
   var
      poison
      nutrition

   corpse
      frog
         nutrition = 10
      spider
         nutrition = 6
         poison = 5
mob
   var
      corpse = /obj/corpse
   Die()
      new corpse(src.loc) //create the corpse here
      del src

   spider
      corpse = /obj/corpse/spider
   frog
      corpse = /obj/corpse/frog
</xmp>
