## & operator
**See also:**
*   [&= operator](/operator/&=)
*   [operators](/operator)
*   [\| operator](/operator/%7C)
<!-- -->
**Format:**
*   A & B
<!-- -->
**Returns:**
*   The binary \"and\" of A and B.


A and B must be between 0 and 2\*\*24 - 1, giving an effective
width of 24 bits. 

If A and B are lists, the result is a list
that contains only items that were in both lists, in the order of list
A. 

If A is an icon or /icon datum, it is blended with B which
can be either a color or another icon. This is identical to the +
operator. Transparent areas in either icon will be transparent in the
result.
