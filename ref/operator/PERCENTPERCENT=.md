## %%= operator 
###### BYOND Version 515

**Format:**
+   A %%= B


Set A equal to `A %% B`. It is shorthand for `A = A %% B`.


`A %% B` is read "A modulo B", which stands for the remainder
of A divided by B. This version of the operator works with fractional
values for A and B. 

If A is a vector, it will be modified by
this operation.
