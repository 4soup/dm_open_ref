<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>A ^ B
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The binary "xor" of A and B.
</dl>

<p>A and B must be between 0 and 2**24 - 1, giving an effective
width of 24 bits.

<p>If A and B are lists, the result is a list containing items that are in
either list but not both. list(1,2) ^ list(2,3) is equivalent to list(1,3).
The items found only in A come first in the result, followed by any items
found only in B.
