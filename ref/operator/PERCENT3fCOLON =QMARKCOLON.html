<p>This is used to access the procs and vars of an object.  It is just like
the : operator, but if the object is null, the access does not happen and
there will be no runtime error.  (A runtime error can still happen if the
object is valid but the property is not available.)

<p>When used in an expression to read a value or call a proc from a null
object, the result of the expression is null.  When used for assignment,
the assignment will not happen, and the expression being assigned will not be
evaluated, if the object is null.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
var/mob/M           // M is null by default
M?:name = "futz"    // assignment is skipped because M is null
world << M?:name    // M?:name reads as null because M is null
M?:Move(loc)        // call Move() mob proc; again nothing happens

M = new
M?:name = "futz"    // assignment is made because M is valid now
world << M?:name    // outputs "futz"
M?:Move(loc)        // call Move() mob proc for M
</xmp>

<p>When reading <code>A?:B</code>, it's roughly equivalent to <code>A &amp;&amp; A:B</code>
except that <code>A</code> is only evalulated once, even if it's a complex
expression like a proc call.  Making an assignment to <code>A?:B</code> is
the same: A is evalulated only once, and if it's not null then an assignment
is made to its B var.

<p>This is identical to the ?. operator, except that ?. will check at compile
time if the property is valid for the object type (if known).  For this
reason ?. is usually safer.
