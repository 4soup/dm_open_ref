<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>The remainder of A / B.

<p><tt>A %% B</tt> is read "A modulo B", which stands for the remainder of A
divided by B.

<p>This is a newer version of the <tt>%</tt> operator that supports all
numbers, not just integers. It is equivalent to <tt>B * fract(A / B)</tt>.
The <tt>%</tt> operator does the same thing, but truncates A and B to integers
first.

<p>A can be a vector instead of a number; B can also be a vector in this case.

<p>If A is a pixloc, it's treated like a 2D vector and the modulo operation
is done with that instead.
