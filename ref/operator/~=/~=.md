**Format:**    
:   A \~= B    
<!-- -->    
**Returns:**    
:   1 if A and B are equivalent; 0 otherwise    
Equivalence is a looser version of equality:    
-   Two lists are equivalent if their contents are the same. (This is a    
    shallow comparison, so it doesn\'t check if the Nth items are also    
    equivalent, only equal.)    
-   Two [/matrix](/ref/matrix/matrix.md) values are equivalent if their components    
    are the same.    
-   Datums A and B are equivalent if A    
    [overloads](/ref/operator/overload/overload.md) the \~= operator with a proc that    
    returns true for B. Without an overload, they are only equivalent if    
    they\'re the same object.    
To check if A and B are equal, use the == operator.    
Note: For code compiled in version 516 or later, [associated    
values](/ref/list/assoc/assoc.md) in lists are also checked for equality. This was    
not the case for older versions.
