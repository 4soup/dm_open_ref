  ## \~= operator {#operator byondver="512"}
  **See also:**
  :   [\~! operator](ref/operator/~!)
  :   [== operator](ref/operator/==)
  :   [!= operator](ref/operator/!=)
  :   [operators](ref/operator)
  <!-- -->
  **Format:**
  :   A \~= B
  <!-- -->
  **Returns:**
  :   1 if A and B are equivalent; 0 otherwise
  Equivalence is a looser version of equality:
  -   Two lists are equivalent if their contents are the same. (This is a
      shallow comparison, so it doesn\'t check if the Nth items are also
      equivalent, only equal.)
  -   Two [/matrix](ref/matrix) values are equivalent if their components
      are the same.
  -   Datums A and B are equivalent if A
      [overloads](ref/operator/overload) the \~= operator with a proc that
      returns true for B. Without an overload, they are only equivalent if
      they\'re the same object.
  To check if A and B are equal, use the == operator.
  Note: For code compiled in version 516 or later, [associated
  values](ref/list/assoc) in lists are also checked for equality. This was
  not the case for older versions.
