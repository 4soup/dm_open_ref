<p>This is a relatively safe way to check if an item is in a list, because
the value of <tt>List</tt> is allowed to be a non-list value, such as null.
Compare to <tt>List.Find(A)</tt> which will fail if <tt>List</tt> is not an
actual list.

<p><tt>List</tt> can also be an atom, in which case <tt>A in List</tt> is
equivalent to <tt>A in List.contents</tt>.

<div class=note>
<p>The <tt>in</tt> operator has a lower precedence than
<tt>!</tt>, which can be a point of confusion. If you want to check if
something is <i>not</i> in a list, it's a common mistake to try <tt>if(!A in
List)</tt>. Unfortunately the <tt>!A</tt> part is evaluated first and becomes
0 or 1, so you're really asking if 0 or 1 is in the list. The correct way to
check if something is not in a list is to wrap the <tt>in</tt> operator and
its operands with parentheses, as in <tt>if(!(A in List))</tt>.

<p>Similarly, the assignment operators also have higher precedence than
<tt>in</tt>, so <tt>has_thing = thing in src</tt> will not be interpreted as
you might expect. Again the solution is to use parentheses, e.g. <tt>has_thing
= (thing in src)</tt>.</div>

<p>The <tt>in</tt> operator is also a modifier for some procs such as
<a class=code href=#/proc/locate>locate()</a> and
<a class=code href=#/proc/input>input()</a>.

<p class=performance>Note: For <a href=#/list/associations>associative
lists</a> there's a faster way to see if an item is in that list. The
lookup of <tt>List[A]</tt> in an associative list is relatively fast, so if
the associated value is always expected to be true (not null, 0, or an empty
string), you can use <tt>List[A]</tt> instead of <tt>A in List</tt> in those
situations.
