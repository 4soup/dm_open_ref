<p>A <tt>/sound</tt> datum is created by the <tt>sound()</tt> proc or by
<tt>new/sound()</tt>. It can be used to change the way a sound file will
play. When you're ready to play the sound, just send it to a player like
so:

<xmp>
var/sound/S = sound('bubbles.wav')
usr << S
</xmp>

<p>The sound file can be supplied as a list of choices, in which case the
client will play the first compatible sound in the list.
