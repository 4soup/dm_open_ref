<p>This value is set by the <tt>SoundQuery</tt> proc and represents the
length, in seconds, of a sound playing on the client. Frequency is taken into
into consideration, so a higher frequency means the sound takes a shorter time
to play and therefore has a shorter length.

<p>Other uses for this var may be considered in the future.
