<p>Within the falloff distance a 3D sound stays at the constant loudest
volume possible. Outside of this distance it attenuates at a rate
determined by the falloff.

<p>Higher values will make sounds fade out more slowly as they get farther away.
The distance of a sound is set by <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, and <tt>z</tt>.
