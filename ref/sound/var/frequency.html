<p>Any value from -100 to 100 will play this sound at a multiple of its normal
frequency. Set to 2 to play at double speed, for example, or -1 to play
backwards. A value of 0 or 1 will play the sound at its normal frequency.

<p>Set to a specific frequency (in Hz) outside of the -100 to 100 range to change
the playback rate of the sound. A negative value is also allowed. The value 0
means that the sound should be played as-is. This value will take effect when the
sound is sent to a player.

<p>CD-quality sound is sampled at 44.1 KHz, which is a value of 44100. Other
common sample rates for .wav files are 8000, 11025, and 22050. (11025 is
usually a good quality for most sound effects without making file size too
large.) If you know the file's sample rate, doubling the value will play it at
a higher pitch and twice as fast; halving it will play it at a lower pitch and
twice as slow.

<p byondver=515>To make a sound play at a different speed but keep its pitch
intact, set <tt>frequency</tt> to the speed multiple you want (e.g., 1.2 for 20%
faster) and set <tt>pitch</tt> to the inverse (e.g., 1/1.2).
