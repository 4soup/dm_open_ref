## len var (sound) {#len-var-sound byondver="513"}    
**See also:**    
:   [vars (sound)](/sound/var)    
:   [SoundQuery proc (client)](/client/proc/SoundQuery)    
This value is set by the `SoundQuery` proc and represents the length, in    
seconds, of a sound playing on the client. Frequency is taken into into    
consideration, so a higher frequency means the sound takes a shorter    
time to play and therefore has a shorter length.    
Other uses for this var may be considered in the future.
