## len var (sound) 
###### BYOND Version 513
**See also:**
*   [vars (sound)](/ref/sound/var.md) 
*   [SoundQuery proc (client)](/ref/client/proc/SoundQuery.md) 

This value is set by the `SoundQuery` proc and represents the
length, in seconds, of a sound playing on the client. Frequency is taken
into into consideration, so a higher frequency means the sound takes a
shorter time to play and therefore has a shorter length. 

Other
uses for this var may be considered in the future.
