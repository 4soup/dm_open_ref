<dd>0 (any channel)
</dl>

<p>For sound effects, set to 1 through 1024 to choose a specific sound channel.
For values of 0 or less, any available channel will be chosen. If you play a
null sound (no file) on channel 0, the settings for the datum will affect all
channels.

<p>If you want to make any changes to your sound later on via the
<tt>SOUND_UPDATE</tt> status flag, you <i>must</i> specify a channel for it.

<p>This var may be filled in by the <tt>SoundQuery</tt> proc, but only for
sounds that had a specified channel to begin with.

<p class=didyouknow>Note: If you don't specify a channel to play a sound, the
client will choose a channel automatically but it will <i>not</i> conflict
with any specific channels you choose for other sounds later. This means if
you play some sounds with channel 0 but then later want to play something on
channel 1, you don't have to worry about channel 1 being taken.
