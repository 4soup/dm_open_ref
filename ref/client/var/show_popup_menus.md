## show_popup_menus var (client)

**Default value:**
+   1


This variable may be used to turn off the popup "context"
menus that are displayed by default when an object on the map or stat
panels is right-clicked. If client.show_popup_menus==0, then
right-clicks will instead be passed to the various mouse functions.
