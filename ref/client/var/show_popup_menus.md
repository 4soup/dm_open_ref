**Default value:**    
:   1    
This variable may be used to turn off the popup \"context\" menus that    
are displayed by default when an object on the map or stat panels is    
right-clicked. If client.show_popup_menus==0, then right-clicks will    
instead be passed to the various mouse functions.
