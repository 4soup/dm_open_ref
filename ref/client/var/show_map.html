<p>This variable may be used to turn off the view of the map in Dream Seeker.
This could be useful for making text MUDs where the rooms are turfs (ie most
rooms can be laid out on a grid but you don't want the user interface to show
the map in any way).

<p>The following example shows one useful combination of settings.  Note that
setting <code>world.view=-1</code> also disables the map, but it also sets
the default value of the <code>view()</code> depth in such a way as to always
return an empty list.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
client
   show_map = 0 //Text is best!
world
   view = 0     //You can interact only with objects in same turf.
mob
   density = 0  //Allow multiple mobs in a room.
</xmp>
