  :   [show_verb_panel var (client)](ref/client/var/show_verb_panel)

  **Default value:**
  :   \"Commands\"
  All verbs with category \"\" (the default value) are treated as though
  they had this category setting instead. In other words, this is the name
  of the panel that contains them. You could even turn that panel off by
  setting this value to null.
