<p>This is a list of images that are displayed to the user.  The output
operator is one way to add entries to this list.  Deleting an image object
will automatically remove it from the display, but if you want to retain an
image (so other people can still see it), it can be removed by directly
modifying this list.

<h3>Example:</h3>

<xmp>
var/image/I = new('image.dmi',usr)
usr.client.images += I  //display it
sleep(50)
usr.client.images -= I  //remove it from the display
</xmp>

Displaying the image can also be achieved like this:

<xmp>
usr << I
</xmp>
