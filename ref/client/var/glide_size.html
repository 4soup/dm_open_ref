<p>Note: The way this setting is used depends on
<a href=#/world/var/movement_mode>world.movement_mode</a>. See
<a href=#/{notes}/gliding>Gliding</a> for more details.

<p>This controls the number of pixels the map is moved in each step during
scrolling of the map.  The default value of 0 chooses automated control over
this value, which generally results in a minimum step of 4 pixels that is
increased when necessary to keep up with motion of the map.

<p>Be careful about using small step sizes.  Icons with high contrast
pixel-level detail can look pretty ugly when displaced by short distances.

<p>This was renamed from <tt>pixel_step_size</tt>.
