<dd>#define PASSWORD_TRIGGER "assword:"
</dl>

<p>This defines a special text <em>trigger</em> used to detect when the user
is being prompted for a password in telnet mode.  Most MUDs automatically
suppress password echo, but if they do not, it is necessary to use this
setting to hide it.  Multiple triggers may be defined as necessary.

<p>The example above is more robust than the more polite version because it
works whether they capitalize the 'P' or not...
