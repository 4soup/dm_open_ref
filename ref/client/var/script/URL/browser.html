<p>DM Script can be used to effectively make a hyperlink in a web document
to a BYOND world.  This is done by making a DM Script file that defines the
desired URL.  It need do nothing more than that.  When a user clicks on the
link in a web browser, DreamSeeker will pop up, execute the script, and
connect to the specified URL.

<p>Some browsers may need to be configured to know what to do with a DM
Script file.  For example, in Netscape, you can add an entry to the list of
helper applications.  You should add a MIME type called
'<code>application/x-dms</code>' with the description 'DM Script' and the
extension <code>dms</code>.  Have this execute DreamSeeker with the
<code>.dms</code> file as an argument.

<h3>Example:</h3>

<h3>myworld.dms</h3>
<xmp>
/*If your browser shows you this, you either need
  to install BYOND (it's free!) from www.byond.com,
  or you need to configure your browser to execute
  DreamSeeker with DM Script (.dms) files.
*/
#define URL "byond://myworld"
</xmp>

<h3>myworld.html</h3>
<xmp>
<html>

<head><title>
Welcome to My World
</title></head>

<body>

<p>You can connect to my world
<a href=myworld.dms>here</a>.
