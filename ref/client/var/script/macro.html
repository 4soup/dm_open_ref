<p>Macros are just like aliases, except that they are triggered by a single
key (or combination of keys) instead of a full command.  When a macro is
executed, it returns a text string which is then executed as a command.  So
a macro is just a short-cut for entering a command.

<p>The following example illustrates the syntax for entering a typical set
of macros.

<h3>Example;</h3>
<xmp>
macro
   ALT+I return "inventory"
   ALT+SHIFT+I return "inventory\nequipment" //multiple commands
   ALT+s return "say \..."             //command to be edited
</xmp>

<p class=compatibility>Note: In old versions of BYOND, character keys required
the Alt key to be pressed to trigger the macro, and did not include
<tt>"ALT+"</tt> to do so. This behavior has changed, and the name of the macro
is just like the format used in skin files. You can now use a key name, and
modifiers like <tt>SHIFT+</tt>, <tt>CTRL+</tt>, <tt>ALT+</tt>, <tt>+REP</tt>,
and <tt>+UP</tt>. Old .dms and
<a class=code href=#/client/var/script>client.script</a> files (prior to
version 507) should be updated accordingly when recompiling in a newer
version.
