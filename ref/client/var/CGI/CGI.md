## CGI var (client)    
In CGI mode, DreamDaemon is normally being executed by a web server and    
accessed by a web browser. The CGI object is an add-on to the basic    
client object for handling this case.    
The CGI object is defined and documented in a separate code library    
`html/CGI.dm`. You can find the current version at    
[www.byond.com](http://www.byond.com/developer/Dantom/CGI).
