## default_verb_category var (client)
**See also:**
+   [category setting (verb)](/ref/verb/set/category.md) 
+   [show_verb_panel var (client)](/ref/client/var/show_verb_panel.md) <!-- -->
**Default value:**
+   \"Commands\"


All verbs with category \"\" (the default value) are treated as
though they had this category setting instead. In other words, this is
the name of the panel that contains them. You could even turn that panel
off by setting this value to null.
