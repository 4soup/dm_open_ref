<p>This controls the size of the map window in Dream Seeker.  Normally, you
would simply compile with world/view assigned to whatever you want, but in
some cases, you might want to customize the map size for different players,
such as admins or subscribed users.

<p>Like all other view sizes in DM, this may either be a <em>view depth</em>
or an absolute size.  A view depth is a single number that determines how far
from a center point the edges of a square viewable region extend.  A value of
5 creates edges which are 2*5+1 = 11 tiles long.

<p>The newer, more flexible syntax is a text string of the form
"WIDTHxHEIGHT".  For example, a view depth of 5 corresponds to "11x11".  Using
this syntax, you can create non-square views as well.

<p>The maximum view size is about 5000 tiles, or roughly 70x70.
