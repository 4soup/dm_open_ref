## world.md    
**See also:**    
:   [procs (world.md)]/world.md/proc    
:   [vars (world.md)]/world.md/var    
The world.md node is used to define some global properties for the world.md.    
Like the other types, the world.md has overridable vars and procs. New vars    
and procs cannot be defined under world.md though; to make global vars and    
procs, use /var and /proc instead.
