This controls whether the world advertises itself in the [BYOND    
Hub](http://www.byond.com/games/) when it has an open network port for    
accepting players. The visibility of the world still depends on whether    
any of the connected players has their location reporter turned on, and    
that in turn relies on the pager being turned on.
