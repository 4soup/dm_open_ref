<p>When a player connects to the world, the world is searched for a mob with
the player's key.  If one is found, the player is connected to that mob.  If
none is found, a new mob of type world.mob is created and the player is
connected to this new mob.

<p>The default value is /mob.  Setting world.mob to 0 prevents the creation
of default mobs.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
world
  mob = /mob/newbie

mob/newbie
  Login()
    src << "Welcome, [name]."
    ..()
</xmp>

<p>This example will connect new players to mobs of type /mob/newbie.  They
are welcomed when they connect.
