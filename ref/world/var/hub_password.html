<p>If <code>world.hub</code> is set, any live session of the game will be
attached to the specified BYOND Hub page.  Under the default settings,
any game can set <code>world.hub</code> and attach itself to any BYOND
Hub page.</p>

<p>To beef up security, you can set a hub password in your hub's
configuration page via the BYOND website.  This will ensure that
only authorized copies of your game can attach themselves to your
hub page when live.  Then simply copy that password into your code as
<code>world.hub_password</code> so that your game's live broadcast will
be accepted by the hub.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
world
   hub = "Dan.PipeStock"   //registered hub path
   hub_password = "UPAggnJaeXmSBoKK"   //password for live game authentication
</xmp>

<p>Note that for security reasons, reading this variable at runtime will
return a hashed version of the value that was set.</p>
