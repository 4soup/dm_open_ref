<p>This is the time (in 1/10 seconds) since 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 2000
(also known as the BYOND era).

<p>Because this is a large number, BYOND's number system isn't capable of
enough precision to deliver the exact number of 1/10 second ticks. It usually
rounds off to the nearest several seconds. For more accurate readings use
<code>world.timeofday</code>.
