<p>This is the tile size that will be used as a default for icons in the
world. It can be set to a single number that represents both the width and
height, or you can use a format like "[width]x[height]" (such as "16x48") to
specify width and height separately.

<p>This value affects several calculations, including icon operations and
gliding between turfs.

<p>Note: If you do not use a square icon size and you are using a topdown map
format, you may experience display issues if setting <tt>client.dir</tt>
to <tt>EAST</tt> or <tt>WEST</tt>. A non-square tile with a topdown map format
will also interfere with pixel movement. For this reason, square sizes are
recommended when using any topdown-view map format.
