<p>At runtime, this value may be changed to let the BYOND hub know about
certain changes in the game's status. An example for using this value is if
the number of players in the game gets too high and most new logins are
rejected, you can set game_state to 1 to let the hub know this server is
full.

<p>The following values are accepted:

<dl>
<dt>0</dt><dd>Normal status</dd>
<dt>1</dt><dd>Server is full</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that this value does not affect how your world actually reacts to new
players logging in. It is only used by the hub and website.
