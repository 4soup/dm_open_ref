<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>Tick()
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>When:</b>
<dd>Called during the server tick, after sleeping procs and queued commands,
just before map information is sent to the clients.

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>None.

<p>This proc allows you to do any updates just before map info is sent out.
One possible use for this is to run a movement loop, or sync up any user
interface input that might have arrived and deal with it all at once.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
world/Tick()
    for(var/client/C)
        if(C.mob?.move_dir)
            try
                step(C.mob, move_dir)
            catch
                // empty catch, just so a failed step won't break the loop
</xmp>

<p>Note: The tick will not wait if this proc sleeps. It effectively has
<a class=code href=#/proc/set/waitfor>set waitfor=0</a> already built in.
It's a good idea not to sleep in this proc or any of its callees at all,
since it will keep getting called every tick.
