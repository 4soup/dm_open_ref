<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>SetMedal(medal, player)
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>1 if the medal was awarded successfully, 0 or null otherwise.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Args:</b>
<dd>medal: name of the medal being awarded
<dd>player: a mob, client, key, or ckey
</dl>

<p>Awards a medal to a player. The proc will return 1 if it is successful, or
0 if the medal was already awarded. If the world already knows this medal was
earned before, the hub will not be contacted.

<p>This proc will return null if there was no way to reach the hub. Use
isnull() to check for a null value. Contacting the hub may take a few
moments, so it is a good idea to use spawn() to avoid holding up the rest of
the game.


<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/monster/dragon
   Die(mob/killer)  // assume Die() is a proc all mobs have
      spawn()
         if(ismob(killer) && killer.key)
            world.SetMedal("Dragon slayer", killer)
</xmp>

<p class=security>Note: You can specify a different hub path and hub_password
by adding these as extra arguments, but this is not recommended for security
reasons. If you use this feature, it should only be on games that cannot be
downloaded by the public.
