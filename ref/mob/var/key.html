<p>For player mobs (PCs) this is the value of the player's key.  For
non-player mobs (NPCs), this is the value of the "desired" key.  This means
that if a player with that key logs into the world, he will be connected to
that mob (as opposed to a new one of type world.mob).

<p>Setting the mob's key will cause a client with the same key to connect to
the mob.  Any other mob with the same key will lose it.

<p>Key values are always compared in canonical form (ie the form returned by
ckey()) so setting a mob's key to "Dan", "dan" are equivalent as far as
controlling player linkage.
