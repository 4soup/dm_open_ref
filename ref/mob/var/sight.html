<p>This controls which objects on the map the mob can see.  The default
value of 0 means that the mob can see all objects that are visible and lit.
Different flags in this var can be set to extend or limit this range.

<p>The following bit flags are encoded in mob.sight:

<xmp>
SEE_INFRA // can see infra-red objects
SEE_SELF  // can see self, no matter what
SEE_MOBS  // can see all mobs, no matter what
SEE_OBJS  // can see all objs, no matter what
SEE_TURFS // can see all turfs (and areas), no matter what
SEE_PIXELS// if an object is located on an unlit area, but some of its pixels are
          // in a lit area (via pixel_x,y or smooth movement), can see those pixels
SEE_THRU  // can see through opaque objects
SEE_BLACKNESS // render dark tiles as blackness
BLIND     // can't see anything
</xmp>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
usr.sight |= BLIND     // turn on the blind bit
usr.sight &= ~BLIND    // turn off the blind bit
usr.sight |= (SEE_MOBS|SEE_OBJS|SEE_TURFS)  // turn on several bits at once
usr.sight &= ~(SEE_MOBS|SEE_OBJS|SEE_TURFS) // turn off several bits at once
</xmp>

<p><tt>SEE_PIXELS</tt> draws everything and then covers hidden turfs with
blackness. It is supported in topdown maps only, not in other map formats. It
does not mix well with other flags.  In practice, <tt>SEE_PIXELS</tt> acts as
if <tt>SEE_BLACKNESS</tt>, <tt>SEE_TURFS</tt>, <tt>SEE_OBJS</tt>, and
<tt>SEE_MOBS</tt> are all turned on. That is, all atoms are drawn even on
hidden tiles, and black squares are also drawn to cover them.

<p>The black tiles rendered by <tt>SEE_BLACKNESS</tt> and <tt>SEE_PIXELS</tt>
are drawn on the default plane 0.
