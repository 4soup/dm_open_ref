## mouse handling


Various mouse actions may be handled by defining procedures
either on the client object or on the atomic object being manipulated.
Any of the following procedures may be defined:
-   [MouseDown()](/ref/client/proc/MouseDown.md) 
-   [MouseUp()](/ref/client/proc/MouseUp.md) 
-   [MouseDrag()](/ref/client/proc/MouseDrag.md) 
-   [MouseDrop()](/ref/client/proc/MouseDrop.md) 
-   [MouseEntered()](/ref/client/proc/MouseEntered.md) 
-   [MouseExited()](/ref/client/proc/MouseExited.md) 
-   [MouseMove](/ref/client/proc/MouseMove.md) 
-   [MouseWheel](/ref/client/proc/MouseWheel.md) 
-   [Click()](/ref/client/proc/Click.md) 
-   [DblClick()](/ref/client/proc/DblClick.md) 


In general, define only the procedures you need, because extra
communication overhead may be avoided when the compiler detects that you
do not care about certain events. 

The arguments used in mouse
procs generally follow one of these forms:
For Click(), DblClick(), MouseDown(), MouseUp(), MouseEntered(), MouseExited(), and MouseMove():
+   client/Click(object, location, control, params)\
    atom/Click(location, control, params)
For MouseDrag() and MouseDrop():
+   client/MouseDrag(src_object, over_object, src_location,
    over_location, src_control, over_control, params)\
    atom/MouseDrag(over_object, src_location, over_location,
    src_control, over_control, params)
For MouseWheel():
+   client/MouseWheel(object, delta_x, delta_y, location, control,
    params)\
    atom/MouseWheel(delta_x, delta_y, location, control, params)


The `location` argument varies with the type of control. For
the map, it will be the turf where the mouse action happened. For info
controls (statpanels), it will be the name of the statpanel where the
action happened. For grid controls, it will be the cell where the action
happened. For others controls it may vary, but most will leave this
blank. 

The `control` argument is the ID of the skin control
where the action happened, such as `"mappane.map"` or
`"mainwindow.banner"`. 

The `params` argument is text, and can
be converted to a list using [params2list()](/ref/proc/params2list.md) .
It may contain any of the following properties, which will only be set
if they are used:
-   icon-x, icon-y: Pixel coordinates within the icon, in the icon\'s
    coordinate space
-   screen-loc: Pixel coordinates in screen_loc format
    ("[tile_x]:[pixel_x],[tile_y]:[pixel_y]")
-   left, middle, right: Mouse buttons pressed, held, or released in
    this action (see compatibility note below)
-   button: Mouse button pressed or released in this action (see
    compatibility note below)
-   ctrl, shift, alt: Keys held down during the mouse action
-   drag-cell, drop-cell: Cells involved if using a Grid control
-   drag: The button used for dragging (only sent for unrelated mouse
    up/down messages during a drag)
-   link: If the mouse is over a link in maptext, or this event is
    related to clicking such a link
-   vis-x, vis-y: Pixel coordinates relative to the icon\'s position on
    screen


The icon-x/y coordinates are integers, and try to point to the
actual pixel in the icon before any atom transforms are done; i.e. if
the icon were scaled up to 3 times its size using the transform var,
then a 3Ã—3 region of pixels would all have the same icon-x/y values. The
lower left pixel of the icon is 1,1. The vis-x/y parameters are
screen-based, and their origin (1,1) is wherever the lower left corner
of the icon is rendered. 

Note: vis-x/y will not be included in
the parameters if they are the same as icon-x/y. 

If the mouse
is over an overlay, icon-x/y and vis-x/y are relative to the parent
object, not the overlay icon itself, so it\'s possible to have value
outside of the normal range of 1,1 to [width],[height]. 

The
mouse pointer may be customized as well. The following variables all
deal with the appearance of the pointer. They do not control what
actions may be taken by the user, but they provide hints to the user
about what actions may work.
-   [mouse_pointer_icon](/ref/client/var/mouse_pointer_icon.md) 
-   [mouse_over_pointer](/ref/atom/var/mouse_over_pointer.md) 
-   [mouse_drag_pointer](/ref/atom/var/mouse_drag_pointer.md) 
-   [mouse_drop_pointer](/ref/atom/var/mouse_drop_pointer.md) 
-   [mouse_drop_zone](/ref/atom/var/mouse_drop_zone.md) 
-   [mouse_opacity](/ref/atom/var/mouse_opacity.md) 


When selecting a mouse pointer, you may provide your own custom
icon or use one of the [built-in pointers](/ref/DM/mouse/pointers.md) 
Note: Older games compiled prior to BYOND 4.0 had a different format for
the `MouseDown()` and `MouseUp()` procs. These used `icon_x` and
`icon_y` as arguments, but `control` and `params` have replaced them.
Note: Games compiled before version 514 did not have the `button`
parameter, so they handled the `left`, `middle`, and `right` parameters
differently. In old versions, only the button used in the action (left,
middle, right) was included as a parameter; now all buttons being held
or changed are included, and `button` is the mouse button that changed.
