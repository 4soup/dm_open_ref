<p>Files specified in single quotes are loaded (at compile time) into the
world cache file (ending in <code>.rsc</code>).  These are referred to as
resource files.  At runtime these files are downloaded by players into their
<code>byond.rsc</code> file for future use.  With the appropriate verbs or
through savefiles, players may also upload files into the world cache.

<p>If a resource file is not used for a long time, it will be automatically
removed from the cache file to save space.  If a cache file gets too bulky,
however, you may manually delete it and start from scratch.

<p>To make compilation faster and to make it easier to distribute code, the
compiler will use an existing cache file if possible.  That means you could
compile up a world, and send people the <code>.dm</code> and
<code>.rsc</code> files without any need to package all the individual
resource files.  It is also possible to include additional supplementary
<code>.rsc</code> files by using the <code>#include</code> statement.
