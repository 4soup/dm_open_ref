<p>The <code>#include</code> statement causes the compiler to process another
file before continuing in the current source file.

<p>If a file is included multiple times, only the first occurrence will be
processed. That is a convenient addition to the standard C preprocessor, which
DM otherwise emulates quite closely. If you want the file to be included more
than once, put the line <tt>#pragma multiple</tt> somewhere in the file.

<p>The file <code>&lt;stddef.dm&gt;</code> is automatically included before
all other source code. You can view the contents of that file by creating a
file with that name in Dream Maker.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
#include "test.dm" // checks ./test.dm
#include <test.dm> // checks lib-path/test.dm
</xmp>

<p>The BYOND lib directory is called <code>"lib"</code> and is located in the
BYOND system directory (typically <code>"\Program Files\Byond\lib"</code>).
If the file is not found there, it also looks in the user lib directory, which
would typically be <code>"...\Byond\user\<i>login-name</i>\lib"</code>.

<p>Note that the compiler interface allows you to include files graphically by
simply clicking the checkbox next to the file.  This creates an include
statement for you in the <code>.dme</code> project environment file.  The only
time you would still want to manually include files is when you need to ensure
a certain order of processing.  For example, if file <code>"MyCode.dm"</code>
overrides procedure definitions of an object defined in
<code>"LibCode.dm"</code>, you should include <code>"LibCode.dm"</code> at the
top of <code>"MyCode.dm"</code>.  Most other DM code is independent of order,
but overriding procedure definitions is not.  The compiler will warn you in
such cases if you forget.

<p>Another case in which you should manually include files is if you are
writing a library to be used by other programmers.  Since the
<code>.dme</code> file is not distributed with a library, all necessary
inclusions must be made in the <code>.dm</code> files.
