<p>The global type modifier makes a var permanent and shared.  This means
only one copy of the var is maintained.  Otherwise, separate copies of the
var are maintained for each instance containing the var (be it a proc, mob,
obj, etc.)

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/proc/Counter()
  var/global/count
  src << "Count = [++count]"
</xmp>

<p>This example increases the count each time the proc is called.  If count
were not declared global, the displayed count would be 1 every time.
