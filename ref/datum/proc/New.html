<h2>New proc (datum)</h2>

<dl><dt><b>See also:</b>
<dd><a href=#/atom/proc/New>New proc (atom)</a>
<dd><a href=#/client/proc/New>New proc (client)</a>
<dd><a href=#/proc/new>new proc</a>
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Format:</b>
<dd>New()
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>When:</b>
<dd>Called when the datum is created, for example by using <code>new</code>,
when reading an object that was stored in a <a href=#/savefile>savefile</a>,
or when the world is initially created.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>Default action:</b>
<dd>None.
</dl>

<p>You can use the New() procedure to do more complicated initializations
than are possible in the object definition where you assign the initial
value of variables to constants.

<p>The following example makes use of the "Location" parameter that is passed
to objects of type <a href=#/atom>/atom</a>.  You can pass any number of
additional arguments to New() by passing them to the <code>new</code>
instruction which creates the object.

<h3>Example:</h3>
<xmp>
mob/night
   var/mob/squire/my_squire
   New(Location)
      my_squire = new(Location)
      return ..()
</xmp>

<p>Also note that the type of object being created in this case was
automatically inferred from the variable type on the left-hand side of the
assignment.  That's a handy little DM short-cut.
