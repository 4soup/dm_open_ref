This is an open source project meant to allow the DM Reference to be edited by the community and serve as a space for people to use the "better" reference.

At this time it's a very early-stages work in progress!

This repo is maintained by F0lak.  If you have any questions, comments or concerns, hit me up on Discord in the BYONDiscord server.
