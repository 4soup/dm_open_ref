# About open-ref
This is an open source project meant to allow the [DM Reference](https://www.byond.com/docs/ref/) to be edited by the community to allow us to make fixes, corrections and ammendments and expand upon it.

This repo also contains the tool used for splitting the reference provided by BYOND.com: ref_splitter.py.  At this time the documentation for the tool is contained in the script itself.

You can join the BYONDiscord server to discuss this project [here](https://discord.gg/pTFccGgnAr)

> [!NOTE]
> Due to limitations with the way that github displays markdown, some formatting may not work on the github document, but formatted markdown is still included for integration with Discord bots, etc.
