This is an open source project meant to allow the [DM Reference](https://www.byond.com/docs/ref/) to be edited by the community to allow us to make fixes, corrections and ammendments and expand upon it.

The reference is currently built with the documentation for BYOND version 516.1644 alpha

At this time it's a very early-stages work in progress!

This repo also contains the tool used for splitting the reference provided by BYOND.com: ref_splitter.py.  At this time the documentation for the tool is contained in the script itself.

This repo is maintained by F0lak.  You can join the BYONDiscord server to discuss this project [here](https://discord.gg/pTFccGgnAr)
