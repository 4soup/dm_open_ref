# About open-ref
This is an open source project meant to allow the [DM Reference](https://www.byond.com/docs/ref/) to be edited by the community to allow us to make fixes, corrections and ammendments and expand upon it.

This repo also contains the tool used for splitting the reference provided by BYOND.com: `ref_splitter.py`.  At this time the documentation for the tool is contained in the script itself.

The discord bot is also available here as well, under the bot folder.
